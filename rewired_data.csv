1,Writing Task-1:In the lecture we heard about the Altruism which we normally see in humans and animals
1, It is the opposite of selfishness
1, In this lecture the Meerkat is the mammal that stands as a guard when other animals are in pursuit of their prey
1, In this the chance for the guard Meerkat for escaping from the predator is quiet easy but for the other animals it is very hard
1, They are in the danger position
1, If we consider the humans if anyone donates a kidney to the other person who is a relative of that particular person or a stranger
1, Then he is appreciated by the family and the society
1, But in the case of Meerkats one Meerkat can easily escape from the predator by running in the burrow but the other animals who are in search of their prey are in the danger position
1, The author opposes this in the lecture 
1,The animals also sacrifice their food and also their life for the sake of the other animal or a group
1, So one should develop Altruism so that they will be appreciated by the society
1, So the Meerkats are a good example for Altruism
1, Writing Task-2:Now-a-days many children are seeking independence from their parents and some want to live with their parents
1, If the children are staying away from their parents and living independently many problems occur sometimes
1, If we live with our parents we can live happily and we can help our family
1, These days people are giving importance to the money but not the relationships
1, The people are not close to one another
1, For example let us take a student who lives independently
1, If he is given lots and lots of money then he will get addicted to some bad habits and sometimes he might use the money for the wrong purpose
1, But if we people live with our parents their is no chance for them to get addicted to a bad habit
1, It depends on the mindset of the person and also the circumstances he face daily
1, The situations around them will change their mindset
1, Some people want to live independently
1, If they live independently they can study well and makes it easy for them to achieve their goal
1, If we observe outside many people are studying or doing the jobs lonely living away from their parents
1, The people should be given individuality so that they can focus on their goals
1, But living with the parents will help one to develop good qualities and also a good behaviour
1, These days people are lacking the qualities of good
1, So the young adults should live with their parents only
1, The parents should not restrict the children to a certain things because they will become rude and they get habituated to certain things
1, One should understand the situation and behave accordingly

1, Writing Task-2“Young people enjoy more than the older people do
1,”Young people enjoy more than the old people is the correct statement because they have the time and energy in that stage but old people don’t have as much as the young people
1, Generally in the college days the young people in groups will go to the recreation places ad also visit many sightseeing places along with their friends
1, Young people have the habit of enjoying free time with the friends and family whereas the old people don’t have the energy and tendency of their mind towards the enjoyment

10,Professors are not mostly appears on Television
10, But showing themselves on tv have its own advantages and disadvantages sometimes
10,Professors come to television shows to share their knowledge to all the people who may not attend the high reputed universities
10, Their research which is done for many years can be shared with all the people
10,By doing this there are advantages for TV networks professors and also the public
10,For professors who appears on the screen their ideas will be shared with public who can get many appreciations for their work
10, And also get good reputation for themselves
10,For universities which there professors work for also get benefited by this to get good reputation and a positive feel about the university for having such good professors
10,But the disadvantages of showing on TV can also be like waste of a lot of important time which can be used for their research instead
10,And it is also known that professors who show themselves on screen are not invited to important meeting
10, As they share everything to public and also sometimes do not get money for their research
10, So showing upon TV have advantages and disadvantages of its own
10,
10,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for another animal or group of animals
10, Altruism is something to different to selfishness; where we can see them in Meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa
10,These animals guard the group while the other animals are busy keeping fed themselves they give a cry alarm to the group to indicate the danger of the predictors on them
10, This takes them to grave danger and lets them starve
10,It can also be seen in humans as they donate their food and clothes to other people who require it and also donate blood and body organs who requires them
10,But as per the lecture it is said that Meerkats make it more danger to the groups by guarding to the predictors as their cry allures predictors easily and the guarding meerkat also make other groups react with their cries
10,And as humans get little much of reward for their donations like name and fame which wouldn’t be of any materialistic use
100,Altruism is one the behaviour in animals and humans
100, behaviour of Altruism results in sacrifying the need to group around humans and animals so that they feel comfortable and satisfied by helping
100,in todays Altruism in humans have become rare because of selfishness and competency world
100, the freedom for the people is dying because of lack of altruism in people
100, Not all animals have behaviour like altruism because of one type of species that has sacrificed food and life to help others that happened in africa
100, some may have that nature but most of the times they won't 
100,dogs sacrifice their life to help one who feeds it with food but it doesn't heps the other dog
100,the behaviour of altruism depends up on the types of animal species and the humans up on their nature and locality in which there are living
100, to summarize the topic i believe that one can get gain after his sacrificeyoung adults usually wants to have independence from their parents in some state and also love to live with their parents
100,younger adults are more intelligent and make things faster than they are before because of they come across various types of environments
100, I think its better to live their families because the parents give birth to a child and they look over them better than any other by giving their love to their child they think that their child is good and smart than any other and they dream over their child's future by giving effective needs to them
100, there is one example to support this reason is my childhood friend who was born in middle-class family and he is very intelligent
100, their parents work hard to run the family
100,he was interested in higher studies and their parents helped him for his studies regardless of their their position
100, now he is job holder in top mnc company and made his parents happy too
100,so that if we live with our families than we can achieve any goal regardless of our position where we stand by with love with our families
100,I conclude that we should help our parents and should live with them for whole life because they helps us from our childhood and takes care of us and they achieve nothing by helping us
100, so we should understand the point and try to be with our family as long as we live
100,
100,Writing Task-1The passage is talking about the benefits of the appearance of professors on television and the lecture opposes the appearance of professors on television
100,Now a day’s some professors are giving their ideas on television to get reputation for their university publicity but the time is wasted to travel to the studio and sitting in front of cameras
100, If the spends that time for their university students they would be benefitted
100,Professor giving a lecture on television or sharing their ideas may increase the knowledge for the people who watch it but it doesn’t meet the standards of the lecturer
100, Some professors share their ideas about current affairs history or movies but it doesn’t help the people who watch it but it can be done by the media persons in a efficient manner and it also diminishes the name of the university of the professor who works in
100, rather than giving such ideas on television if the works on this experiments or solving the doubts to their students may help him for his career
100,Because of the above reasons it may seem disadvantage for the professors appearing on television and it would bring negative impression for the professor or his/her university
100,Writing Task-2I agree with the statement “Young people enjoy life more than old people do” but the enjoyment may differ by their age and the responsibilities that they have
100,Young people enjoy their life by studying and achieving more knowledge about the science or the outside culture
100, Education is the key to achieve to achieve success and enjoyment because one can earn respect by achieving knowledge in specific field
100, For instance my friend achyuth is the best example for this
100, He is working as software engineer in google
100, He used to work hard in studies from his childhood
100, He used to solve the problems in an online website and he used to enjoy by it
100, this was seen by google company and recruited him as software engineer
100, So he is enjoying his life in way that cannot be measured
100, This is the one of the instance where is support having knowledge in young life can make life happy

100, She used to enjoy by playing as shehas no tensions and responsibilities at young age

102,Altruism is a type of behaviour in which an animal that sacrifices their eating habits to another animal or for the particular group of animals in the group with their own interest
102,Altrusim is the opposite of selfishness
102, Every individual that performing altruism doesn’t gain anything
102,Example of altruism is: they are abounding to both humans and animals according to passage but whereas according to the lecture they are bound to themselves (animals and humans)
102, A new topic arises called eating habits such as sharing food habits donation of blood and the body organs to the strangers and to the family members so that they think that if they behave in a altruistic way it will be benefited to another members in the same way as sacrificing their eating habits for the sake of another
102, Many species such as animals and humans are willing to share food habits or even their life for the benefits other members in the or for the assistance of the other members in the group and therefore it is fact
102, The meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa often cited as an example
102, In groups of meerkats every individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while other animals are hunting for their food or eat the food that they have obtained every day
102, If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as predator such as a hawk approaching the group it gives an alarms cry altering the meerkats to run and seek shelter
102, By standing guard it will not get anything and it will grow itself into danger
102, After issuing an alarm it has to feel alone and it has to take risk to a predator
102, So animals should work together in a group to overcome these risks when the danger arrives from other side of the group and also from the outside of the group
102, So the altruistic behaviour helps you to survival of the other members in the group
102, In my opinion I will give preference to the young adults who are staying with their parents because if we stay with our parents they will give strength to us in case of any unbearable situation whereas if we get a freedom we will be misuse with them and many people are committing suicides for some reasons like due to the torture done by the educational institutions due to love failure due to the misuse of cell phones in the younger age because when the children ask parents to buy a cell phone we should restrict them because they don’t know how to use them and to operate them
102,Many people are committing suicides for different different reasons 
102,For example we nirbhaya death created the serious issue where their parents and government fought for them for years together for the sake of solution due to the attack of the nirbhaya by the terrorists
102, In some movies also there will be an example that would bring awareness to the people
102,In other case if we will live with our parents this will not happen and this kind of issues will not appear
102,

102, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices

102, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
102,The School day is sometimes essential and not essential to the students because when it is essential we can learn many new things but when it is not essential we can’t learn many new things due to the lack of concentration

11,Everyone thinks that professor is recognized or reputed if he/she appears on television but the fact explained in the video is that they are more disadvantages rather than advantages
11, Lecture as summarized few points as professors won’t have sufficient time to learn new things or technologies in their related fields and most important thing is that they are wasting their valuable time by fixing to camera angle and for do doing their rehearsal
11, rather than they can spend more on reading books doing research
11,But according to the reading passage they stated that professors will be reputed when they appear on the television not only professor even college will be benefited
11, Professors will be benefited because by doing so they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider campus consider if a professor publishes views in an academic journal only scholars will learn or view it but when he appears in electronic media thousands I people will aware of the narrow academic community become aware of the professor’s idea Not only professor is reputed even college gets benefited for example when a professor appears on T
11,v viewers can know how well the college is reputed and how things are going to be done in that particular if a college has expert professors that improves the reputation of the college in addition to that college will get more donations for the university and more potential students

11,ALTRUISMAltruism is a special kind of behavior which exists only in mammals and animals they scarifies their own interest for the other group of animal and the lecture part they also stated that it's nothing will be helpful to them
11, Firstly the passage stated that they never found this type of the survey regarding meerkat ever been done before they got to know that it sacrifies it's own life for some other group of animals or group of animals
11, Meerkat is the only type of mammal that dwells itself in the burrows of grassland areas and they also act as sentinel guard and looking out for predators while other hunt for food or eat food they have obtained and best quality in the animal is it's gives a alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter it might be starving for a long time and after that it issues an alarm it has to flee alone so this altruistic behavior helps other group of members of the meerkat's group 
11,Lecture stated that they never found this type of behavior in the ever been done research towards meerkat this animals they will starve for other group of members and it's makes some sort of alarm so that they can know what it wants to communicate and they also stated that humans tend to hide the things what they have and wont share with ours where as meerkat's share everything even their life for other group of animals they if sentinel predator such as hawk is approaching the group it gives a specified alarm which can be listened by a specified group of animals and they can find the food and run to save their life where as the meerkat which gave an alarm has to talk alone and need to starve for food until the predators go the lecture also stated an example that in case of humans if any of the friend or family member has suffering from the kidney problem we won't give up our own one kidney to them by even we have a option to survive the life without kidney but in case of Meerkat's they just give up their life for sake of other mammals or animals I conclude that Meerkat's set a perfect example for the unselfishness they even share their food they shelter and most importantly their lives for other animals 
11,This kind of animals set a great impact in the social life

13,Writing Task_1 Professors are the most respectable people in the society
13, These are the people who are bring fame to a country
13, However these days the professors are into television programs which would effect their life
13,It can be in the form where one professor getting reputation among other professors resulting in celebrity status
13, Through which he/she is branded as entertainment professor
13, Most of the time when professors go to a TV shows they generally waste their time spending hours on preparing content and focusing on camera
13, This contradicts the idea of professors getting fame and followed by their universities
13, Finally professors waste their time by getting into TV shows
13,Students can't approach the professors as they will be busy in the TV shows
13, Generally the TV channels doesn't require the actual in depth knowledge of the subject they are just considered with the title of the program so as to attract the general public
13, Thereby resulting zero knowledge with the viewers

13, Writing Task_2 Young people enjoy life more than old people do Life is full of experiences
13, In ones phase of life from younger age to old age every individuals enjoys
13, However in most of the cases the people who are young are considered to be more enjoying
13,As the young people have much time to spend in leisure they engage themselves in many fun or entertaining activities
13, Youth is like a brand new bike it runs very fast as we raise our zeal and as the years pass the bike turns to slow down
13, Anyone in the world has to agree to the point that “Most of the knowledge is acquired in their young age”
13, The youngsters explore the world by traveling visiting new places and when it comes to the old people they don't have much time to explore as they will be occupied with household responsibilities and also their physical body will not support as they are aged
13, The old need to take care of their children or grand children
13, On the other hand the youngsters can manage themselves and they are likely to move apart from one place to another and enjoy life in their choice
13, More of the explorations and invention are done by the people at their younger age
13, For instance the founders Flipkart Facebook Watsapp Snapdeal Telegram are of very young age
13, Although there are few people in the world who are old and enjoyed their life like Dr
13, Abdul Kalam
13, They stay still as role models for the youngsters portraying their life as an example of enjoyable life
13, Whether it is young or old life is all about enjoying and moving on

15, Now the technology also makes the young like social Medias which attracts them also which gives the entertainment too but whereas old people don’t show all these interests in their life
15, Moreover old people enjoy their life by fulfilling the wishes of their children and the family members
15, This is what they (old people) want actually as they grew old day by day

16,TASK-1The following lecture and the passage through’s light on the different opinion when professors teach in the colleges and on television
16,The lecture talks about the professors who give television shows about the lecture to improve knowledge for people watching TV doesn’t show professionalism
16, Professors should be in the college teaching students rather than on the studios giving lectures in the television
16, He says that this kind of act doesn’t showcase the seriousness of the professor
16, -Firstly Being on television will be more of an entertainment program rather than educating people
16, Due to this some professors may not be invited to the important conferences or meetings
16, They also cannot make money to do their research
16, If education is to be done then college or the universities are the best place to gain knowledge
16, Professors should be available for the students to teach or to clarify their doubts
16, -Secondly Time management
16, Time which is very important for a professor should spend time on education students in the universities by directly interacting with them
16, The time spent for the journey to the studio what to present getting ready to look good on television the shooting process etc eats away the time which can be used to solve students problems or doing research
16,So finally who benefits
16, Not the audience or the students
16, The TV reporters does not need the pure lecture
16, This would be devition of the professor who can spend time at the research or at the university
16,The passage talks about the benefits of the professor being on television
16, Professors are normally found in the universities but sometimes they attend for the guest lectures on the television giving expert ideas or commentary
16, There will be a great benefit to the professors as well as the university
16,Due to this the professors acquire a wide range of reputation and popularity which is not that effective on campus
16, They will be widely known for their knowledge
16,They told about the difeerence that if a professor writes a journal about his lectre only a limited people will read and get to learn from it
16, where as if he presents a show on televion then many people can watch and there is a scope for many people to gain knowledge from his research
16,This is not only advantageous for the lecturers but also the university gains a huge amount of reputation
16,It will lead to positive publicity of the university
16,The improved reputation of the university will automatically lead to high donations
16,The other advantage is that the public will get to know things as most of the people will not have contact with the university professors
16,But this people will get to know the taste of knowledge the professor have and many new things
16,
16,This passage explains about the unselfishness acts of the creatures
16,The given passage and the related video explains us about the Altruism which is a type of behavior in which the animals sacrifices its of interest and some times even their lives for the other animals or the other group
16, The individuals performing the act does not get anything for themselves
16, Altruism is the opposite to selfishness
16,This topic can be explained by taking few examples
16,The examples for this Altruism may be a human or a mammal
16, A human unselfish act states that they can share their food and even donate their body parts to others or family members
16, This is the unselfish behavior of the human
16, In the same way there are many species who sacrifices anything for their group of members
16, Meerkat is one among them
16, Meerkat is a mammal that dwells a burrow in the grasslands area of Africa
16, In this group every individual acts as a sentinel stand guard etc
16, they look for the predators which attack while the other eat their food or hunt for food
16, As soon as they sense for any kind of danger they give a alarm to the others by giving a alarm cry so that all the group gets into their burrow for safety
16,By doing this it gains nothing
16, In fact it gets into more danger
16,So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat group
16,Being with family is totally different from being independent
16, There are many advantages and even flaws in both the cases
16, I support young adults should stay with their families to understand relationships
16, It is their time to feel responsible
16, They should take up responsibilities be a backbone to their families
16, Staying with the families directly impacts the behaviours or the habits of the young people
16, They will get to know some moral ethics
16, They will get to know the behavior
16, They will get to know the responsibilities
16, How to make relations and how to maintain it effectively
16, Independence doesn’t mean they should be left free to do anything they want
16, People should be there to guide us and help us
16, In the same manner we should learn to take decisions
16, we should learn to live life on our own
16, Individuality is not about leaving your family and staying alone
16, Individuality is about taking decisions learning new things
16, Family is the place where you can be yourself
16, The young mindset will be in such a way that they will not like people guiding them telling them something suggesting them
16, It is a stage where they feel they know everything
16, they can do anything
16, They can achieve anything
16,but the main thing todays generation to understand is to know the importance of their families
16, Yes you achieve anything even you don’t stay with your family but you will not get the support love care from anyother source that our families give us
16,Accordingly the parents also should support their children
16, Give freedom to them
16, Encourage them to get their goals
16, allow them to get some memories from their young age
16,by doing this the parent children relationship is going to be strong and bonded effectively

17,TASK-1Unselfish acts among the humans range from sharing of food with strangers to donation of organs to the family members and even to strangers
17, Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another yet provide little rewards to the one performing the act
17, The meerkat individual acts as a standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained
17, If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as hawk approaching the group it gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter
17, By standing guard the sential meerkat gains nothing it goes without food while others eat and it places itself in grave danger
17, After it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it more risk to a predator since animals in group are often able to work together to fend off a predator
17, So the altruistic sentinal behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat's group

17, As we think we know everything but we don’t know anything when the problems arises
17, For example if there is a situation that some financial matters arises in the family
17, The adults cannot take the decisions properly because they don’t have a alround idea about the problem and they don’t know how to handle the situations arising by that problem
17, Parents provide us the right way and they mobilise us to take decisions at right time in that instance
17, Generally when any problem arises we can’t decisions properly but our parents can handle them easily
17, They make us to move in a right way
17, Parents are the one who are going to make us learn the things to the real life incidents
17, Generally if we observe in some houses if any discussion is going on parents used to ask the opinions of their children
17, This is because they are going to analyse the ideology and thinking capability of their children
17, If they thought that they are not in the correct way of thinking they will the situations and they guide us to think and take decisions in all the situations
17, When we are with our parents we can learn many things by observing them

18,If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?“It’s better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times
18,” This is a Russian proverb which says that how travelling is important in one’s life
18, Not only have to see a place but travelling makes a lot of difference in our daily hectic and stressful life
18, People say live with no excuses and travel with no regrets
18, That is why I always choose a place to go on vacation which helps me to forget my stress and experience a new excitement in me
18, What is that place you ask? It is Theme Park Malaysia
18, And why do I want to go there? Read on to find out! The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
18, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
18, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
18, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
18,According to a famous English proverb - “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!” By implementing a longer school day we would be effectively condemning the children to the same fate as Jack

18,Task 1: Writing Based on Reading and ListeningTitle: Professors on TV news programs Professors are normally found in university classrooms offices and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students
18, They also appear as guests on television news programs giving expert commentary on the latest events in the world
18, In some aspects these television appearances are of great benefit to the professors universities and audience too
18, But there is another side of coin as usual where there are oppositions to this point
18, Professors benefit from appearing on television because by doing so they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much audience than they have on campus
18, But it was opposed as most of the professors appear as guests have no good knowledge on research fields and those kind of professors will not be invited to important seminars on research
18, Professors who are completely involved in research or lecturing students have no leisure time
18, These kind of TV programs kills professor’s time in all aspects
18, So who does benefit then? Even audience are not much benefited because professors can’t teach academic concepts on TV 
18,If he tries to do so TV network operators will not agree as they need only highlighting latest concepts rather than important topics
18,Young people enjoy life more than older people doPeople of different perspectives enjoy in different ways
18, They have their own world of happiness where one may go into that world at young age and other may go at old age
18, But young people have strength to conquer the whole world
18, This point may support the statement “Young people enjoy life more than older people do”
18, Let us discuss some points which support and oppose the given statement
18, According to me People are categorised in four ways based on the way they think regarding life
18, They are 1
18, People who give much importance to achieve goals and dreams
18,2
18, People who give much importance to money
18,3
18, People who give much importance to lead life in normal and peaceful way
18,4
18, People who doesn’t give importance to anything in their life
18, In the first case people may enjoy in achieving their childhood dreams and goals
18, So these people will have their enjoyment in young age and old age too
18, But people who strived through hurdles many years may enjoy at his old age recollecting his/her success stories
18, In the second case people will only think about money
18, They may think money can only give the happiness but they ruin all their young age in earning money and they also ruin their old age in thinking about how to invest money earned
18, So these people will not get satisfied at any point of their time
18, In the third case people may enjoy with their family and friends and lead a peaceful life 
18,This kind of people enjoys in young age and old age too
18, In the fourth case people will have no goals and dreams and do not think about anything and will not take anything serious
18, They just enjoy with what they have at that moment but it is volatile
18,Some people will face many problems in childhood and may settle in good position in their young age those kind of people will enjoy old age
18,I conclude this topic with my opinion that I disagree with the question that one cannot say Young people enjoy more than old people because it depends upon one’s perspective and interest

18,Altruism is a type of behavior which we can see in both among humans and other mammals
18,Recent studies revealed some interesting points about meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa 
18, Meerkats are the best example for altruism in animals
18, When meerkat groups are out in search of food a sentinel meerkat (one of the meerkats) will stand as a guard and look out for predators while others hunt for food
18,When a predator like hawk approaches the group sentinel will give an alarm cry and run into a burrow
18,The other groups will be aware of predator so that they will defend themselves
18,Likewise some people will be altruistic 
18,They can either share their food with others or even share their bodyparts with relatives or strangers also
18,Those kind of people do not need any rewards or awards for their altruism
18,The non-materialistic awards make them feel hapy
18,Some adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible 
18, Other young adults prefer to live with their parents
18,I strongly believe in second situation and I am one of the young adults who prefer to live with their parents
18, parents are the ones who made us what we are now 
18, we have to show minimum courtesy to them being their children

19,”This is a very good introduction
19, It's about the right length; gives a little relevant background and context indicating that the writer has thought about what a stereotype is in its broadest interpretation; makes some initial references to sources; and finally focuses precisely on the question showing the reader that it has been fully understood and that it will be answered
19, Note that the wording of the final part of the introduction is very close to that of the question

20,Professors are usually found in university classrooms offices or libraries
20, But if we watch television the professors are seen there also
20, So the topic is the appearances of professors on televisions
20, According to the passage the appearances of the professors on television have certain advantage
20, But according to the speaker there are disadvantages too
20,Let us first consider the advantages
20, Firstly the professors benefit from appearing on television because they earn reputations as authorities in their fields
20, For example if the professor publishes an academic journal only the scholars will know about it
20, But if the professors comes on television the chances are that more people might know him
20, Secondly the universities also benefit from the professor’s appearance
20, Because when people see a faculty from a university on the television they think the university is reputed and the funds for the college might increase
20,Now there are certain disadvantages too
20, The first disadvantage is that if a professor comes on television we cannot say that the professor is knowledgeable
20, Because usually the professors with limited work experience in the work and research think of television as medium to gain fame and raise funds for their research
20, Second for the television appearance there might be a lot of time waste for the professor
20, Because to appear properly a certain amount of time is needed for the make-up
20, And to present well time is needed for rehearsing
20, The time for journey is to be counted too
20,So the appearances of professors on television have advantages along with some disadvantages
20, Not all the professors that come on television are knowledgeable
20, At the same time some professors might be from really reputed universitiesYoung people enjoy life more than older people do
20, This is a phrase we come across very often
20, Irrespective of the country / state we might have heard this phrase from at least one person
20,I according to my personal opinion I disagree with the statement
20, Yes young people might enjoy
20, But we cannot say that young people enjoy more than older people do
20, According to me people enjoy not depending on the age but the company in which they are
20, Yes company is a very important thing
20, If you have a good company you can enjoy anywhere and anytime irrespective of the age
20,Let me explain the above statements with examples
20, So let us take example of older people first
20, We see many older people going to the parties movies together along with their friends
20, Sometimes we come across certain families that go for summer tours and seasonal tours etc
20, with their families
20, So we may say older people along with the young people but not more or less than them
20, At the same time we see some older people not going anywhere and sticking to their houses
20, Now let us take the example of young people
20, We mostly find young people hanging out with their friends active and nearly everywhere
20, Young people have friends at various levels like school college and office
20, But at the same time we see some young generation sticking to their computers and not involving in any kind of social activities
20,I conclude by here that we find all types of people in all the age groups
20, So irrespective of the age groups people enjoy according to the situations and depending on their company

21,Task-1Summarize the points made in lecture being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passageIn my point of view professors are well educated and teaches to the others
21, Professors are well known to educate anybody not only in universities and colleges but also outside
21,According to me some students want to join in top universities where they can gain more knowledge from the professors of that university but if they fail to get admission in that university they can learn from the television when they appear as guests on television news programs
21,When the professors appears on the television news programs then there is a benefit to everyone not only the students of that university
21,There is no time waste to the professor by appearing on the television news channel because they will give lectures on the television when they are free but not attending the colleges or classes
21,By giving lectures on the television the professors gets good name and as well as the university and most of the students and employees will to join in that university to learn new more things
21,In my point of view universities get name and fame through professors who are teaching in that university so by giving lectures in television the people can know well about the professors and the university
21,Finally I conclude that the professors appearing in the television news channels will be help to everyone and gets name and fame to that professors and the university
21, Task-2Young people enjoy life more than older people do?According to me young people will enjoy more than the old people because young people have more strength than the old people
21,Young people can go anywhere and can do anything but old people can’t because they don’t have enough strength and lack of interest
21,As people becoming old and old they lose there strength and also they can’t enjoy as the young
21,Young people can go anywhere and in any type of climatic conditions but the old people can’t and they can’t survive in some climatic conditions as young people can survive
21,For example a young man can travel anywhere can go to the pubs and also many places where the old people can’t 
21,As people becoming older and older the way of thinking and the attitude will be changed because they don’t have that much strength
21,The older people will give many suggestions to the young people because as they experienced everything before
21,Mostly we find most of the young people are working in industries companies and different work places because young people can work and more than the old people because in less time the young people work more than the old people

22, Another source would be television shows on the topic of communication
22, Moreover college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment

22,It is important for us to communicate with the society just by our voice and actions
22, Communication plays a key role in work place
22, As it alone can help you to talk with others and help work along 
22,It is easy to speak in our own body language but with people who doesn’t know our language should enrich our thoughts by our body language mainly Communication There are seven Ethics in Life for good speaking at work place:Stop-Gossiping: The first main thing to be done is not to speak about a person at his/her absence
22, This also increases your ability in society

22, Some people believe themselves as great and judge themselves
22,Negativity: In our society than good we see the negotiation is increasing day-by-day as we don’t look after the positive end
22, So complaining on little things and stopping your work at effective places where you work shouldn’t be done instead please to be rejected
22,Excuses: We know some things happen without our permission and should be left at soft corner
22, But this should not be done everywhere

22,Emboridery and Exaggeration: Our body language is the key to success 
22,It also depends on attitude and the knowledge where embroidery comes around
22, Lying to people and believing them that’s the truth is known as Exaggeration
22, Dogmatism: The last thing and important thing to remember is dogmatism which is a confusion of facts with opinions
22, The client or employees will be confused to slap on with side first at wrong or right

22,Five projects during the semester
22,
22,TASK: 1Altruism means one animal or human sacrifices for their own group
22, It means without any selfishness and there own interest which gives benefit for others
22,In many of the species willing to sacrifices their food and help in other ways without having benefit
22, For example like Meerkat is a mammal one of the species of grass lands area of Africa in which one from the meerkat group acts as an Sentinel which guards the one of the meerkat group by standing alone and looking for the predators who are approaching the group and others search for the food or eat they obtained food
22, If one of the predator approaches the team it gives an alarm cry so that others can understand there is a danger
22, In this case when there is danger it gives an alarm and get into there borrows
22, The others who are searching food are now in danger because due to this signal the predator can find actual place of the meerkat and other thing is that due to this signal the meerkat of the other group gets confused and this signal from his own sentinel and try to save themselves
22, This sentinel doesn’t have food but still it can save from the predator and it is benefit for the meerkat standing as guard
22,In case of human beings without selfishness their share their food and others with friends as well as strangers
22, For example a person can donate his own kidney to their relative and unknown person it is like sacrifice that person donating kidney saving the life of other person but that person has a benefit is that person gets name and money for his sacrifice so person gets benefit for the sacrifice
22, TASK: 2A Person should achieve something should work independently
22, Young adults are the persons who can work hard can live there life independently without helps from their family
22, This Kind of people likes to live individually
22, So they think to have freedom from parents and live life in a different way as they like it
22, Young adults have the good maturity level can think on their take decisions own and they have enough confidence to do anything
22, In my point of view a person who can live individually can learn more about the world
22, Young adults can live individually without anyone’s help and can face the world and can solve any problem on their own
22,But In case of persons who likes to prefer to live with families and have no freedom of doing something on their own have many restrictions and follow instructions of the family persons and their suggestions create boundary around us and should live in that boundary
22, It creates loss of Independence to us and the young adults can’t live this type of life so they think to have independence as early as possible
22, As there are many advantages and there are disadvantages young adults who live individually sometimes can’t handle the situations and want some help
22, At that time we should build your confidence and face the situation and handle the situation is important
22, So handle this situations increases the confidence
22,
22,Writing Task-1In universities there are well knowledge professors who can teach well and good at subject
22, We can see they can share knowledge and can understand by the students
22, There are some professors give guest lectures in television in order to share the views about the latest things what happening in the outside world
22, This helps to get awareness for the students about the latest things
22, They are benefited of this lectures and will find new paths to get knowledgeable
22, This gives benefits not only for the students and also the professor because they get reputation for the guest lectures
22,The guest lectures give less benefits to audiences because the lecture provide by professor will be summary this will available in the internet and more benefit to the professor because professor can increase standards in the university
22, There is a loss for the professors because of this television lectures they are not get into some important meetings about the academic discussions
22, There is another lose many of them think professor just to get famous persons from this guest lectures in the television
22,The Universities also be benefited of this lectures by having the publicity about the university and more students will try to join the university
22, Students with high potential show interest to join in the university
22, The students in the university will suffer because professor will not be in the campus for most of the time spending time to give television lectures and students face problem to clarify the doubts the professor not be available in the campus
22,Writing Task-2 According to me we can enjoy at any age
22, Basing on the age the type of enjoyment changes
22, As a kid we can have one type of enjoyment playing different types of games enjoy watching cartoons in the television
22, Kids play indoor games and outdoor games
22, Youth enjoy watching different type of movies visiting to different places participating in the different competitions
22, The Old people pass the time by studying different type of books listening to the music and that is their style of enjoying
22, When compared to the Young people to the older people young people enjoy a lot
22, Young people enjoy their life by exploring themselves in a different way
22, I think young people will travel different to places finding about the new things and learning about different cultures in the new places
22, Tasting different types of dishes
22, Learning about their life style
22, There some who enjoy trekking
22, Young people are interested in learning new things and enjoy that type of learning
22, They are some young people gives stage shows and mostly young people will go to live performances
22,old people will stay at one place studying different types of books related to god or watching devotional programs
22, Mostly old people take rest lot of time by sleeping
22, Mostly old people stay at home not going outside world
22, Mostly they visit to temples and some devotional meetings
22, They are some who will enjoy at that age
22, Most of them prefer to have daily a routine life
22,So I think young people enjoy more than the old people do

23,Task1Professors on TelivisionIn the lecture there are points which are exactly opposite to the points that are in the reading passage
23, Both lecture and passage are related to the topic whether the professors should give program in news channels on television
23,I will go with the lecture rather than passage because points told by women are correct
23, Now lets look out some important points in the lecture which are disadvantageousMost importantly lots of time will be wasted for the professor when he gives programs on television for not only interviews for also for travelling makeup
23,Research time will get wasted if professors give programs on television Professors can’t spend time with the students for clarifying doubts
23,Moreover will not benefit professors as well as they will not get enough time on doing research
23,College officials will think these professors are not serious and just thinking for reputation but will not do workThese professors will not get call from any important meetings
23,Public is also not interested much in seeing these kind of shows
23,News channels will only call professors because of institutions value but not seeing his own fame
23,These are some important points mentioned in the lecture which I feel is true when compared with passage
23, Passage is only summarises about advantages which is not true
23,*****************Task-2Young people enjoy life more than old people doYes I agree with the statement young people enjoy life more than old people because young people have more energy when compared to old in most of the cases and also as they are young they will be having less responsibilities when compared to old people young people can do whatever they want as they will have energy and time to do but for old people they can’t do any work without the help of young people as old people don’t has much energy
23, For the young people there will be a beautiful life with many excitement things
23, Young people when they are in teen age they will enjoy college life to make it a sweet memory of their life
23, After college when they start working again there will be many excitement things like girlfriends pubs and appreciation in office and in outside
23, Young age is the best age to fulfil their dreams but in the old age we will have dreams but they will not have energy
23, So in my opinion young people enjoy a lot when compared to old people

23,Passage on Altruism1)Altruism is a type of behaviour in which the animal sacrifices its own interest for that of other animals or group of animal2)In a recent study of science they find that meerkats eat before it starts guard with full stomach
23,3)As they stay near the burrow so that they can easily escape into the burrow
23,4)Before escaping to burrows it gives an alarm alerting the other meerkatsso that they can escape from the meerkats5)By standing guard sentinuel Meerkat gains nothing it goes without food while others eat and keeps themself in grave danger6) Altruism in humans is opposite to selfishness
23,7)Altruism is also amongst the humans who donates their kidneys for their family members or strangers and also did not get any appreciation EssayAccording to my opinion I prefer to live with my family members because i love my family and every shoul love one's family because they gave birth to us and when we are like children they teached us how to walk and also how to talkso we should be grateful to our parents and will not leave our parents
23, For example if we want to leave independantwe are suffering with fever but no one is there to help us even though we said no to our parents but our still our parents dont stop loving us that is the affection of parents 
23,So inn my point of view i love to spend my life with my parents for along time
23, But there may be rare scenarios where yound adults are struggling with their parents herrasementso there may be chance of getting indpendent only on that particular scenarios but that is only a rare case as i previously said
23,But many young adults eventhough getting parents love and affection they are thinking that their parents are not giving independance which is wrong
23, Being to be independent is good but it is not life and we cant hurt our parents feelings for such silly reasons
23," For example for independence sake you will leave your home and go to USA for independancebut when you go you will miss your home and also if your relatives or parents are in serious condition you can't even come and meet your parents or relatives and also there is a saying in english that ""Parents are next to god"" and also parents are ""first teachers"" who will teach most important lessons like desciplinehow to speak etc"
23, With this statements I can say that my arguments is true and i can also say that staying with my parents is the only time that i love

23,*Prosody: It is one thing which humans don’t want because it restricts ability to talk*Pace: It is the thing related to voice how much speed we are talkingspeak with moderate pace
23,*Pitch: It is related to variation of the voice means we will show anger with different pitchrespect with different pitch
23,*Volume: It is nothing but the sound related to the voice we must speak audibleConclusion: If we speak powerfully listen consciously(Creating consciousness consuming consciously and designing consciously)the world sounds beautiful

24,Sacrificekindness is the intended nature in Human beings
24,In the passage as stated that meerkats protect thier own kind as a sentinel guard
24,Here we cannot simply state it as a sacrifice
24,But coming to some of the studies show that in the mammal species meerkats though the sentinel acts the guard it guards with the full stomach
24, It signs the warning cry and it goes to the shelter and first protects itself
24, it shows the altruism by sending the attack warning signals in this process sometimes the sentinel may also get into troubleThe animals also show the altruistic behaviour in some cases
24, The animal species mentioned in the passage is meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa
24, The head of the meerkat group is called as sentinel which acts as a guard to the group and warns the group on being attacked
24, On the warning sign all the members of the group will seek shelter and hide themselves
24, In this process the sentinel may get hurted by the attacking ones
24,The Modern man now-a-days should know the moral beliefEthical val;ues which are base and build for the human kind
24,The small things we make for others will occupy big places in thier heart
24,The words from a person whom we dont know may inspire u But it is a responsiblity to protect our kind and it is also a priviliege
24, Humans also respond to the strangers and help the person in need it shows our nature and belief in morals to our own kind
24,Alturism It may be behavior in animals but we are humans we are made up of values morals and ethics
24,The essay is about the behaviour of the young adults
24,Now-a-days the modern adults has brought up by drastic changes
24, Some of the young adults want to be independent and doesn’t want to be with their parents
24, It is a bbig conflict between adults and parents now a days
24,Some of them want to live on thier own while some want to be with parents
24,I support a bit more to the adults who live up with thier parents
24,BecauseSome of the young adults want to make them prove their abilities to survive in the outer world and while some of them want a freedemed lifeof luxury
24, Both cause a unreinforced loss of time
24,The age tendency of adults think that they have the maturity to take decisions about their life and career
24,Where some give up rightly and while some of them a backstabbed due to thier own decisions
24,Adult age is the time where they are supported morallyand encoraged by some one
24,It can be done perfectly by only parents cause every child is kit and kin for parents
24, While some of the young adults want to live with their parents they want to be in their parents guidance
24, But thier need tothem to know the kind and nature of the society as they are going to face a hardened path
24, The young adults is the phase of life in which there is a scope of learning and doing things on their own
24, It also improves the adaptability skills of the person
24,Both of the situations are good but depending upon the situation they need to be aware of what to do
24, When the adults got the opportunity to go to outside and study they need to be aware of the situations in the outer world
24, They should how to be? and what to be and what not to be? Though they want to be independent if they are in close reach to their parents
24, They should stay with their parents as after all we live up for parents by now where our parents lived up for us upto now

24,TASK-1:SUMMARIZE OF LECTURE -1
24,IH201685024 B Dheeraj chowdaryIn the video it is explained how it is different from a university professor and a professor who chose TV
24, In video lecture it states some clear points 
24, They are Some of the professor’s choose to entertain than the profession actually they are meant to be
24, The TV chosen professor’s are generally get over there for fame and position in the society 
24,It brings the conflicts in between the professor’s because some of them with less effort and little are get into overnight fame by television
24,The Tv network is actually a time waste thing as it takes a lot of time to reach and shoot and it takes time to prepare our self for rehersal and to make us good looking
24,The TV networks are actually very commercial in nature where they are in need for academic title but not the academic knowledge
24,They take the advantage of professor knowledge to have a brief discussion on so called history or detailed science thing which cannot be done by a reporter
24,But in the passage we can see other side of the professor version who takes Tv networks as a knowledge spreading tool
24, The points mentioned are:These television appearance’s of professor makes a great benefit of themselves and their universities and to common public
24,They acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider audience than they have on campus
24,A professor can have a larger audience of his idea’s where professor importance as a scholar is enhanced
24, The very few people can have the contact of professor’s now people can easily reach them 
24,The reputation of professor brings the name and fame to the university which brings more donations and applications
24,Television is a medium for commentary that tends to be superficial not deep or thoughtful
24,By professor’s on TV by contrast viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight
24,TASK-2:I agree with the statement for a extend that younger people will enjoy their than the older people
24, Because the younger people are energised and they are active participants
24, They are free in nature and their age tends to make them things which are more enjoyable and memorable moments for a while
24, Where as the older people are came out from the struggled life going through the life expectations and reality making all the wishes of their generations to come through
24, The younger people are free from their responsibilities and duties they are in life of freedom
24, The student life is the most enjoyable and memorable part of every human
24, It can’t be taken back and it can’t be again done by the older people as it looks weird going to school back at the age of 40
24,Where the older people tend to enjoy their life being with family making all their responsibilities fulfilled
24, They tend to enjoy their life by fulfilling their last wishes Which they never made out in their younger
24, See here we have contradiction the both the younger and older get the enjoyment of their life by coming out of the aspects seeing and facing the different situations of their respective ages
24, The older get enjoyed by seeing their younger fulfilling their dreams and wishes
24, For example Bringing new bicycle to his Grandchildren gives a Grandfather happy memory for lifetime
24, Bringing a chocolate to his younger sister makes a brother to be happy
24, Like that the younger generation also find their enjoyment by making their older people wishes fulfil and making them proud
24,For example a smaller brother getting national prize and dedicating it to his brother makes his brother to feel happy and proud A son taking his parents for a world tour
24, Even bringing a delicious sweet to home by a son in the evening times makes a mother happy in tears which cannot be calculated
24,So the younger may enjoy well but they all get older for a while and starts to enjoy as older as their once did before
24, Every moment and aspect of life is memorable if we learn to taste it

24,TASK-11
24, Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? The software development projects generate a large amount of associated documentation
24, The only moderately sized systems will have documentation that fill several filing cabinets; then for large systems it may fill several rooms
24, A high proportion of software process costs is more and Furthermore documentation errors and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption increases the costs involved
24, Therefore managers and software engineers should pay much attention to documentation as its associated costs as to the development of the software itself
24,2
24, What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software?The documents associated with development process of software must contain of some requirements
24, They are:1
24, communication medium between members of the development team
24,2
24, They should provide System information for repository and to management to help them plan budget and schedule the software development process
24,3
24, Some of the documents should tell users how to use and administer the system
24,3
24, What type of documents goes into process documentation?These documents record the process of development and maintenance
24, Plans schedules process quality documents and organizational and project standards are process documentation
24, They can be categorised as 1
24, Plans estimates and schedules : These are documents produced by managers used to predict and to control the software process
24, 2
24, Reports: These are documents reports how resources were used during the process of development
24, 3
24, Standards: These are documents which set out how the process is to be implemented
24,4
24, Working papers Memos and electronic mail messages
24,4
24, Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? Here Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis
24, Progress will normally be reported weekly
24, But memos record thoughts ideas and intentions which change over by a daily basis and instant change
24, So it makes the process documentation outdated
24, process information is of little real use even it is out of date and even there is no need of preservation
24, But there are some process documents that can be useful
24,5
24, What is the role of working papers in software development? These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project
24, They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified
24, They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions
24,
25,The audio and reading paragraph are both discussing about university professors appearing on TV
25,Reading supports professor will be beneficial while audio contradicts it
25,Reading says: professors can become famous by giving TV showsContradicting Audio: That shows the professor is not serious compared to his fellow professorsReading says: universities can benefit from the showsContradicting audio: it says professor time gets wasted in various ways instead he/she can teach and meet the students for making research in the universityReading says: Public can benefit from TV lecturesContradicting audio: no one watches such TV shows at dinner time instead they like some entertainment
25, So there is a chance of lecture going waste
25,They can be compared on basis of responsibilities and energy
25,In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do
25, Young people vigour and energy are sufficient to enjoy life more than older people do
25,Young people do not have much responsibility compare to older people
25, For example older people have responsibility to take care of their children to earn money to complete their work etc
25, These responsibilities make them limited to enjoy their life
25, whenever they (old people) try to do something to enjoy life they give their children the first choice
25, On the other hand young people do not have these responsibilities they are free to choose from variety of options to do for enjoying their life
25,Young people have more energy to do anything
25, In comparison older people usually suffer from some diseases by the time while try and see as much as they can do (young people)
25,To sum up there is a huge difference between young and older people to enjoy their life
25, The older people can also enjoy their life according to their new age

26,TASK -1 ALTRUISMThe passage explains the word called “Altruism”
26,Where Altruism is an act of sacrifice altruism can also be treated as an opposite word of selfishness where in the passage they have compared animals and humans and their altruistic nature In them
26, Here in animals the altruism was explained by comparing the unity of meerkat and they helping nature here in humans they have compared with the sharing of kidneys between the relatives or between the strangers
26,Here the main thing that opposes the altruism is Does the person who is showing altruism getting any recognition by the public or do they get any satisfaction by doing this to the relatives or to the strangers
26, Here in this passage they clearly explained how an altruistic natured person suffers from dangers by showing the example of meerkat and hawk
26,How it get caught by the hawk while saving the remaining meerkats
26,Dont think that altruism is only sharing the human physical parts sharing food and sharing things will also be treated as altruismAltruism also be called as sharing or sacrificing 
26,there are many people who follows altruism TASK-2 Here in this the clear question is that “does leaving parents give us freedom” I support “living along with the parents will be the great situational answer”
26,Because many of the adults think that we don’t have freedom when we are with parents
26,I think parents wont restrict us when we do the right thing according to the situations and the main thing is that don’t try to escape fromthe responsibilities because every person will have some responsibilities towards the family and people wont get a better friends or well wishers than parents
26, Don’t treat your parents as an ATM machines because every adult should share the duties of his parent
26, An adult will think that leaving parents is an independence but leaving parent is “leaving yourself and your independence” 
26,persons will get realized by themselves when they have become parent
26,Summarize the points made in the lecture and how they oppose the points made reading passage
26,There are some points in the lecture which opposes the appearance of Professors on Televisions
26,As mentioned in the passage Professors are normally found in universities classrooms and offices and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students
26, Some of the professors appear as a guests on televisions news programs They may think that it is benefit for their university and they will get reputation by appearing on televisions But spending time on televisions will waste their time which can be used for their researches or They may give a lecture to their student during that timeThere are some Disadvantages for the professors or lecturers who are appearing on televisions
26, They May utilise the time by spending on research
26,They may not be attend to the important meeting in the universitiesThey may not get money for their research
26,No one will be beneficial by doing this
26, As viewers may or may not follow the points which were said by the professors
26, And news channels want academic titles to improve their market but not the intellectual topics
26, And being on television may waste the professor time like travelling time Younger people Enjoy life than older people do
26,I agree with the line mentioned above because
26, Some of the people will think that older People will enjoy their life than younger people but in my view Younger people will enjoy life than older people as older people have responsibilities of their families like wife husband children but younger people don’t have such responsibilities and older people need to earn money for their family 
26,And the energy levels of younger people are more when compared to older people As younger can move any to any place as they are healthy when compared to older people
26, Older people have different health issues compared to younger people as they can’t move from one place to another easily as Younger people and another big advantage to younger people is technology
26,Younger people can go with the technologies in an easy way when compared to older people
26, Younger will make their work easy by using the technology but older people can’t get through these Technologies easily when compared to younger generation Take an example of internet “Younger people can use the internet easily than older people” and many of the application in the internet
26, Younger people can go to trips or to movies easily with their friends or alone
26, But older people need to take the entire family for the trips and movies
26, Older people will think before spending the because the money may be useful for the family members but younger generation don’t have such responsibilities because he/she will get pocket money and they can use it in any way because they don’t have any responsibilities

28, The eating habits of meerkat are quite different
28,In a group of meerkats an individual acts a sentinel standing like a guard and looking for predators while the others hunt for food
28, Sentinel gives an alarm when a predator approaches towards them

28,When youngsters live away from parents they need to mange everything all alone without any help but when they live along with their family there won’t be many responsibilities for them to handle
28,Unlike in individual life living with family generally gives a secured feeling since the surroundings are completely filled with loved ones
28,Staying with family and living individually has its own added advantages and disadvantages separately
28, Youngsters always ask for freedom and independence from responsibilities till they reach to the level of maturity
28, They don’t want to handle anything which creates an extra work for them but staying with family teach a lot of things starting from handling responsibilities care for each other helping etc
28,Individual life is like a free bird at the same time it is hand full of responsibilities and work management
28, The lack of affection care and love is clearly visible in this life at the same time a lot can be learned by living away from family since responsibilities come in to the picture
28,Family life is filled with bonding where as individual life is filled with loneliness
28, Youngsters face new challenges when they live away for family due to which they even gain awareness
28, They even learn to know how to be daring and gutsy as they need to overcome the difficulties and challenges they face in their solo life
28, By developing this nature it becomes an advantage for them when they travel or live alone in any part of world in any age
28, Still living in a family teaches the value of relationships bonding and the process of maintaining them which lacks in individual life

29,Well apparently it has been proven that sentinel guard which sees the predators first gives out an alarming cry to alert the other members of the group
29, This infact helps the predator to focus on the group rather than one since the alarming cry by the sentinel makes the group to either gather at a point or move away towards the safety
29, This gives the sentinel more chances of saving his life
29,Even though Sentinels are brave enough to do such risky tasks it has to be ensured that they attain the importance of their valuable deeds
29,Similarly when compared with the altruistic nature of humans it doesn't depend upon the amount of the work done or the importance of deed it all depends upon the unselfish nature of the society to act altruistic similar to the meerkat

3, This lead to disturbances between the parents and the young adults
3, As the mind-sets of the young adults is aggressive they prefer getting out of the environment and live on their own so that they cannot be questioned by anyone
3, So the concept of independence has come into picture
3,Whereas if the parents understand the change in the generation and adjust themselves accordingly the young adults will never see this problematic and will prefer staying with their parents
3, Staying with the parents is a better option compared to being independent as the independence may create gaps in the relationship between the young adults and the parents

3,Soft SkillsWRITINGProfessors are normally found in University classrooms offices and libraries doing research and lecturing their students
3,Many of the professors are invited as guests in popular TV shows giving expert commentary on the latest events in the world
3, These are of great benefit to both the professors and also the universities
3,Professors benefit from appearing on the TV shows as they acquire reputation as authorities in their academic fields and also have much wider audience than they have in the campus
3,Also if a professor publishes views in an academic journal there are very few people who follow them as only the scholars go through it
3, But if the same views are being presented through a TV show there will be a great increase in the number of viewers and also the professor gets a better appreciation and reputation
3,The benefit for the universities from the professor’s appearance on TV is that they get a great positive publicity to their university which leads to more admissions in the universities and also donations from potential students
3,Finally the public
3, The public gains good knowledge from the professors giving lecture on TV's
3, As most of the TV viewers don’t have contacts with the university professors the TV will be a great opportunity for the viewers to learn from experts and to be exposed to the views they might never come across
3,Television is generally a medium for the viewers to listen to the commentary from the professors and acquire a taste of the real expertise and insight
3,"Essay""Young people enjoy life more than older people do""Enjoyment is a state of being happy by doing something a person likes to do"
3, Enjoyment is given the first priority in a person's life
3, The taste of enjoyment differs from person to person
3, In the state of enjoyment a person undergoes various emotions like happiness enthusiasm fun etc
3, Enjoyment for a person may differ depending on the neighbourhood family individuality friends relatives etc
3,"I strongly disagree with the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"
3,"""People enjoy live in their own ways"
3, For each age group the mode of enjoyment keeps changing
3,A baby enjoys sleeping all the time and playing
3,A kid enjoys playing with parents and going out for a ride with them
3,A child enjoys playing with friends
3,As the child grows older the bond with the friends grow stronger and always find enjoyment with the friends
3,So a teenager finds enjoyment hanging out with friends
3,As the teenager steps into youth career becomes their priority to enjoyment
3, So until settlement the enjoyment becomes the work
3,Youth finds enjoyment in their work and they enjoy their work
3,Once they settle most of them enjoy travelling
3,Once the person gets married the enjoyment lies with the spouse
3,After the couple give birth to a baby their world of enjoyment revolves around their baby
3,They play think care about their baby
3,Once the baby starts growing the enjoyments of the baby starts and the enjoyment of the parents lies on the happiness of their family
3,As they grow old and clear all their responsibilities the older people enjoy life in their own way
3,They play with small children give suggestions to their children out of their experience with life etc
3,So we cannot judge the way people enjoying their life
3, Every person has their own style of enjoyment

32,Randy Paush Lecture1)Randy meant that we cannot change any situation we just have to deal with them in the right way
32, we have to decide how we are going to deal with that particular situation
32,2) The key points included:- One should never give up on their dreams and always follow their dreams  -Have fun at whatever you are doing-Respecting authority while questioning it-Help others -Never lose the child like wonder -Its always fun to do the impossible -Always show gratitude -To never give up -Loyalty should be given and taken 3)Randy talked about six of his childhood dreams:-Being in zero gravity -Playing in NFL  -Authoring an article in World Book Encyclopedia-Being Captain kirk-Winning stuffed animals -Being Disney Imagineer4) Randy meant that one doesn't need to become what they have dreamt
32, He never wanted to be an astronaut he just wanted to fly
32, So being specific regarding dreams meant one need to be very confident on what he wants from a dream
32,5) Brick walls are there for a reason
32, they are not there to keep us out but they exist to show how badly we want things
32, They are there to stop the people who don't want things bad enough
32,6) The things Randy learnt from football is that fundamentals are most important and there should be somebody who can correct you if you are doing anything wrong because if there is nobody to correct you it means they gave up on you
32,He also learnt the power of enthusiasm and the freedom he gained from this
32,7) Randy believed  if you did something when you are young and also trained for it then it becomes a part of that person
32, He learnt the power of enthusiasm team work perseverance hard work and a lot of aspects from football
32, Thats why he was very glad football was a part of his life
32, 8) Randy wasn't sad he that could not play in NFL but he was very much happy because while trying to accomplish that dream he learnt something more important in life
32, While playing football he got a lot of indirect learning (head fakes) such as team work and perseverance
32,"9) After Randy gained some more knowledge in Virtual Reality the officials of ""World Book"" asked him to write an article on his field and thats how he accomplished the dream of writing an article for the encyclopedia"
32, 10) The most important quality Randy learnt from the character of Captain Kirk is Leadership
32, From this character he learnt how to lead people by watching him
32,11) The message Randy has given by winning stuffed animals is that we live in a world which has digitally manipulative things yet we can convince people that we have accomplished some dreams by showing them to people
32,12) When he visited Disney land for the first time he was so inspired and thrilled by it
32, He want to a part of such a thrilling and exciting world and that inspired him to become an Imagineer
32,13)Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress you means that sometimes we will be really angry at people and we might be mad at them it is because we have not given them enough time to be themselves
32, Once we give time to people they tend to understand us more and will impress you someday because their is good in everybody
32,14) The way we communicate is very crucial in every way
32, There is a way of saying anything in two ways that is a good way and a bad way
32, And one has to realize that communicating in a good way is way better than being rude
32,15) When of Randy's students came up to him and asked that he would like to be a part of his team he realized a way to fulfill their childhood dreams by establishing a course in his university
32," He called that course ""Building Virtual Worlds"""
32, This corse had 50 students in all departments that gave the students a sense of excitement of putting on a show that gave everybody to fulfill their dreams
32,TASK1:According to the passage altruism is a type of behavior in which an animals scrifices with there own intrest to the other animal or a group of animals 
32,Where in the audio altruism was discribed as it is a human or an animal done for there intrest

32,TASK2: According to me I would prefer to live with their families for a long time 
32,yesthis days most of youngstars want to independence from their families or parents but i think it would be a wrong idea we should be independent but living with out familie and parents it would not a good idea
32,I belive that it is better for all concerned if young adults can continue living with their parents and families for long time First of all after becoming an adult it is best for every one to head out to embrace our independce
32, Although it is the most important part to earn money for coast of living 
32,fpr instance for foods rent unilits and study to build there future ratherthsn doing part time jobs that me hamper there education
32, It would be most important to live with there parents as if there a only child to parents then if he left them and they want to live independent then at point of time it would be difficult for the parents at the time of there old age so the youth has to be think for a long distance so it would be best for both familie 
32,so they can take care about there parent at surtan point of time and there are many youth adults want to just get ride of the parents after their education and want live their own life independently and it would be not a good idea

33,A technical report on possibilities for Renewable Energy System with Recreational Facility
33,THEME: Reducing the impact of CO2 on the environment by utilising engineering techniques
33, The report shows that complex buildings which are in commercial size are releasing carbon dioxide into the environment in different means those buildings are not built in a way of utilising the renewable energy sourcesTECHNIQUES AND DESCRIPTION:A material with Good thermal properties by selecting materials which enable low fabric heat losses
33, The modern way of designing buildings can be designed to utilise the solar power which is a unlimited energy for commercial purpose
33,Even building Regulation Fact L2 considers the solar energy as a highly recommended one because of its advantages
33,By the utilisation of solar energy power the gases that come out of those buildings due to thermal effect can be reduced when compared to natural heating
33, But this type of designing of buildings require proper plan and a low priority to the cost is given because these require a good thermal property materials are costly
33,And also the building materials that have been selected give high thermal mass to the structure that will give the building a high thermal capacitance and help prevent the effect of wide seasonal temperature swings by giving the building a slow thermal response
33,These buildings are designed with “Ventilation Factor” which explains how sizing of the heat takes place in a building
33, In this consideration process several building service concepts have to be considered that include Natural Ventilation Stack Ventilation Bio mass and passive building design that adds an increase in budget of the project
33,ADOPTED PLACES:These technologies are mostly employed in South England in the UK there main point was to create a building with good thermal properties by selecting materials which enable low fabric heat losses
33, The Victorians were experts in this field 
33,They demonstrated the use of stack ventilation on a commercial scale in places like prisons and Hospitals
33, Similarly others have researched the use of underground air pipe arrays to form supply air ducts
33,So It is the intention of the report to illustrate the renewable resources utilisation like solar thermal system which operate on primary closed loop thermo syphon principle bio mass boilers ventilation techniques can be employed in designing the buildings that can reduce the release of carbon dioxide and other Greenhouse gases into the environment in one way or other
33, Hence by selecting proper materials that have high thermal capacitance for design and its architecture of design can reduce the release of greenhouse gases into environment

33,Read the below given document
33, (10 mins)Write answers for the following questions in 30-50 words
33, (10 mins) Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? What type of documents goes into process documentation? Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? What is the role of working papers in software development? 1a
33, yes they have to pay attention to the cost involved in software development documentation
33, The documentation need not be so long so as to give very in depth of the product to the customer
33, But it should be as much as required to the customer or user
33, If the documentation is so long with a lot of technical stuff present which may or cannot understand by the user easily
33, By making such a long documentation is a is a waste of cost involved
33, So while making development documentation cost has to be considered so that there will be effective management of the capital for the new development
33,2A:The documents should provide clear detail of what a particular software do
33,The documentation should involve multiple columns those may contain for the expert technician service employee that should be understandable for the standards of respective department in an organistaion 
33, Those may contain outlook of design cost estimation servicing and debugging too
33,3A:During the process of development the documents such as test plans and also reports of the tests that helps in understanding the product development and its maintenance and also for the further improvement of it
33, Those should act as an interface between the developer and the manager for the clear understanding of the product design
33, Examples of them are planning plans Estimates schedules reports working papers emails which shows progress
33,4A:the process documentation become outdated frequently because whenever there is the optimization in the complexity of usage of a product there should be again a new documentation of the developer
33,It is not possible to define a specific document set will make upto end
33, So process documentation should involve about the feedback for the test cases so that by considering the feedbacks there will be a better development of the product
33, Hence the process documentation will be outdated frequently
33, 5A:Working papers acts as a key role in development of a projectbecause the working papers involve the ideas of the engineers and also it contain the difficulties encountered in designing the project
33,they also give the decisions that are to be taken further

33,Altruism is a that can be seen both in animals as well as in humans but in a different way
33, This Altruism is seen in animals mainly by meerkat which mainly will go for food 
33,One meerkat will acts as a guard that take care of other meerkat while they are in search of food 
33,The Meerkat which acts as a standing Guard will have a stomach full of food 
33,not because of mainly these animals are found in Africa 
33,By Standing guard which is also called as a sentinel gains nothing after it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it danger they mainly differ that meerkat that go standing guard is said that it gains nothing in the process but before that when it is going to act as a standing Guard it had a stomach full of food 
33,But in the passage it is explained that senitil was gained nothing But there lecture had not explained about the senitil after it issued the alarm for the other meerkat to escape from the dangers or from the predators like Hawk 
33,in scenario the views are both different in explaining about the meerkats 
33,essayMost of the parents in the present society want to make their children a good graduate and then they make them to go in a particular way irrespective of opinions of their children 
33,Some students who are not mature enough about the society and the way of living will definitely have to take decisions about their career and life 
33,In this Scenario we cannot clearly judge about the young 
33,Some young people will follow their own dreams irrespective of their parent opinions but their success rate is vey low when compared to the adults who follow their parents advice 
33,I came to hear about that one of my friend wants to become singer but his parents want him to become a civil servant 
33, when their parents joined him in an institute that gives coaching for civils he did not find much interest in the subjects he tried for 2 years but he did not at least qualified in the exam 
33,He was totally discouraged by his behavior and his parents too not happy with the results he got 
33,their parents cannot afford much more expenditure on him so they set him free to follow his dreams that as a singer but the he lost flavor of the music so he also got rejected in some of the singing competitions by that he had gone insane which is not good for him as well as his parents
33, In the present era the adults are very much known about the society and the life in the society 
33,one may have to achieve their dreams irrespective of their parents opinion they may succeed or may not but they will be happy if one will follow their own dreams 
33,in this world people are of different minded every one has their own dreams and also everyone want to achieve their own
33,finally i want to say that adults become independence from their parents only after they became independent from their parents
33,
33,Young People Enjoy more life than older people do
33,No!! I do not agree with the above statement People who are old nowwere young before and might have enjoyed a lot when they were young
33,As the quote expresses “when there is a will there is a way” will suites present topic very well
33, Life is meant to live happily
33, People find the enjoyment in different aspects Some people feel their enjoyment when they take an adventures alone and some one find enjoyment when their family together will go on a vacation and spend there happily
33, Even the physical disabled persons can enjoy in their own means 
33,So to which extent does the people enjoy depends on the factor “age”
33,Young people are usually find enthusiastic and also mostly they are free from worries and family problems They can easily do what they want like run jump diving etc
33,And also they do need to save money which if they earn they do not even bother about the financial issues 
33,but this is not in the case of older people they always have to take care of their family and have to save the money for their families 
33,As one grows older relations will become narrow and at last they always find only their family relations but where in case of adults and young people will find many friends through out their graduation 
33,People who are old now were once young might have enjoyed a lot more than you are doing now 
33,Not all the young people are enjoying and not all the older people are not enjoying It only depends on the maturity of the mind and finding ways of enjoying
33, There are many people who are old but party harder than the young people do
33, So I finally say that the way of enjoying will differ from person to person and nothing can stops any one enjoying in their own mean
33,I completely disagree with the lecture 
33,The passage describes about the some of advantages of when a professor apperrs on T
33,V
33, Appearing on television will increase the reputation of of a professor But the lecturer was talking about disadvantages on being on TV 
33,When a professor explains something in T
33,V
33,it reaches a lot of people who cannot afford going to big universities 
33,And also when a professor appears in TV he will be known by most of the people thus he can gain reputation 
33,Being in TV for a while does not lose anything students making lectures on T
33,V
33, does not make degrade anyone infact he raises the reputation of the university 
33,When the lecturer said about the travelling time to the studio rehearsal time and make up time does not affect much about the schedule of the professor
33, Not all the professors will get a chance to appear on T
33,V
33,so there are some people who expect some content some content from the lecture given by the professor on the television
33,the lecturer says instead of appearing on television the professor can spend time with the studentsbut in my point of view the same students can also watch the lecture from the T
33,V
33,By that way they also can gain knowledge
33, SoIt does not matter when a university professor appears on T
33,V
33, or not
33,Both of them have their own advantages
33,
34,SUMMARIZATION ABOUT THE LECTURE AND THE PASSAGE1
34, In the passage it was clearly given that Professors and universities are benefited by appearing as guests on television but in the lecture given says that it is not good to appear on the television
34,2
34, In passage they says that appearing on television the university as well as professors get good fame but in lecture it says that it is waste of time to prepare travel and to get ready to look good on camera
34,3
34, Passage clearly explains about the benefits due to rating and donations given by viewers but lecture says that it only focuses on the brief knowledge about the topic where the professors don’t have satisfaction on their presentation
34,4
34, By presenting professors get good reputation but they are seen apart from other lectures due to which the professors were not called for the meetings and conferences
34, This was given in the lecture
34, But in passage it says that due to their presentation they get benefited and they will be known to the people all over the world
34,5
34, Knowledge can be share by presenting and the people who had doubts on particular aspects can clarify their doubts not only the university students all can get clarification on their doubts
34, This helps the professor as well as the management with the positive publicity
34,6
34, But the lecture says that it was waste of time where they can use their time in doing more research works and can attend students and conferences
34,7
34, Televison doesn’t need any intellectual substance it just need that show should benefit them with high ratings only 
34,But in lecture it says that television is a medium of commentary that tends to be superficial not deep not thoughtful
34,8
34, From professors the viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight
34,9
34, But the lecture says its waste to present because it needs only historical versions not the knowledge on the subject deeply
34,10
34, FianalyI conclude by saying that passage had given all the advantages of television and lecture had given all the disavadvantages of the television
34,YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER ONEYes I agree with the statement because we can prove that statement in our daily routine activities
34, Old people also have their feelings to enjoy but due to their age they restrict themselves to certain conditions but Young as they have correct age they enjoy a lot based on the situations they grow up
34,At Younger age only we have a chance to fulfill all our wishes and desires and that is the age we need to achieve something best in our life to enjoy or to be happy at older age also
34,(i
34,e); being independent
34, They have lots of enjoyments like going out with friends enjoying in parties going to the places where we find different new things to see
34, But in older age we cannot move to longer distances even if we have intension to go
34, Our Age restricts us more than our desire
34, So we need to enjoy and get satisfactory hearts for enjoyment in young age itself
34, Older people have lots of family burdens and mainly they need to take care of themselves and their family
34, In that age rather than enjoying their mind tends towards caring and Spiritual side
34, It was proved by many people that as we grow older our thoughts mainly focus on spiritual side
34,For example we if we see our grandparents they sacrifices everything for the sack of the family and they tend to live out of enjoyments like Young people
34, Their only enjoyment is to see their family happy all the time
34, But Young people are interested in going long drives enjoying their whole time with their friends
34, Their thoughts always travel along with the enjoyment only
34, Some people search their enjoyment in their dreams and some in enjoying with friends and some in travelling etc; So Young people search for different ways of enjoyment
34,So here I conclude saying the Young people enjoys their life in different ways because they have different thoughts and plans to full fill their desires but old people even though they have desires they cannot full fill them in terms of enjoyment
34, So Enjoy life everyday so that we need not search for the enjoyment or we don’t even need to count the days of enjoyment we had

34,Hi I would like to discuss about your performance on the current project on networking project
34, You have many positive reviews on the last two projects that you were good at Presentation Skills and team leading Skills and you will do your work on time
34, But recently I have heard that you were late to the meeting last week with the client
34, Client was little dissatisfied with the timings

34, Hopeyou will rectify your mistake and never do it again

34,TASK-1Altruism is a kind of sacrifices that are made by animals and people
34, It is done mainly by group of animals in order provide safety to their creatures
34, It is an act of social boundness between them
34,By doing this type of activity they don’t get benefit bt still follow the principle of altruism
34, Own interest prevails amoung the mammals and people
34, The best example coming to the humans was donating the kidneys and body organs to the people who are in need of it
34, They may be in family relations or Strangers
34, This is an act of human sacrifice where people wont reward and matter about the issue going on But it is and appreciable work done by individuals
34, Mostly these works were not being highlighted or enlighted between individuals where it is really needed to popularize these types of works and also encourage the people who relay donate organs
34, In Mammals a good example has been explained many species sacrifice their food and shelter to other members of their group
34, They protect them from all the dangers coming over them by certain signals and they be as standing guards to protect their group
34, Good example was Meerkat it is an mammal present in grassland areas in Africa
34, It acts as a guard to protect from predator where it sounds like an alarm cry intimating their group to run away and save their lifes
34, They acts as guard even though their life was in danger and risk and they dont know when the danger comes and stands before them
34, Even though it has no food to eat it share with the group members
34, They work together and if danger comes infornt of them they together fight with the teamwork
34, So the Altruism helps the animals as well as people to survive in a group with good co-ordinations and work sharing without Selfishness among them
34,TASK-2Now-a-days people are tending to be independent without any relations to be maintined with the parents
34,I disagree with this type of behaviour adopted by the people around the world
34,This are resulting in many effects where people are not able to get their mistakes done back to rectify them
34, Independent nature doesn’t mean to be independent without the guidance of parents
34,It means to be self confident and self natured which can also be done with the help of parents only
34,We need certain guidelines for the life to be calm going and to learn some things in the life which can made our life more easy and comfortable
34, For example many suicides are taking place in our country because of the loneliness created by themselves without interacting and sharing things with the parents
34,They need a baseline till the age where they know of all the things and measures of life
34, Being with family enhances our relations kind heartness and many emotions can be easily tackled
34, They need to be independent in their carrier and their goal they want to achieve
34,In order to achieve those they need not leave their relations and families 
34, Bonding never give up negative thoughts
34,It only gives us positive feeling and make us learn lot of things
34,Many people due to work stress they are enable to take care of their parents
34,Bt we should spend sometime with them in order maintain relations and it also relaxes us a lot
34,They wont create lonliness feeling when we are together
34, So maintaining relations and being with the loved ones make our life more happy and more positive
34,Never regret relations because they are only the base support Which help us in worst conditions of life

34,If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?“One’s destination is never a place but new way of seeing things”
34, So I would like to go to Simla which is one of my favourite places in India
34, If I get a chance of vacation I would like to go there and have fun
34, It had a great history which had a principal commercial cultural and educational centres situated on hilly region of state
34,The city consists of more temples and churches which takes the attention of visitors in the devotional way
34, Most of the city had buildings in style of neo-Gothic architecture 
34,The most attractive places over their was Rose gardens and horse riding towards the hills
34, Travelling itself was a thrilled experience and climate over their was to cool which make me us to feel that I was in a place where I had never been and makes my heart to feel happy at that movement
34, Kufri is also an attractive place It is winter spot situated 16km away from Simla
34,All these places make me feel to visit this place had to have great time over their
34,A bad day in paris is still better than a good day which we don’t like
34, So opt to the place only based on our own interst not on the importance of that place
34, So I go their because I feel like a pleasant place where I could enjoy lot with my family
34, The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
34, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
34, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
34, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
34,“Great Recess equals to Better School Day
34,”I support to decrease the school hours because people are spending more and more hours in school where they are not having time to play games
34, School days are most joy full and fulfilled with many mysteries to resolve
34,If the school hours are to long children were unable to play creative games and they are missing their golden days of enjoyment with friends as well as parents because after their long journey in the school they are becoming tired and they were unable to spend time with anyone
34, These types of situations involve in many disadvantages like they are mentally habituated to think problems more complex and are enable to make decisions on their own
34, In my school days we sometimes used to play in the rains make paper boats eat ice-creams and enjoy every drop of water 
34,But now-a-days people are missing all these kinds of fun because of heavy stress given to them by the authorities
34,So I think school days should be memorable to each and every child It should not be burden to any one of the children
34, This kind of situation can be obtained only by decreasing the school hours at least by 2 hours so that they can spend time on many of the other creative activities which enhances the creativity in children
34,First movie:One of my favourite movie is YAMADONGHA

34,Sources for College Writing Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments
34, First they can draw on personal experiences
34, For example for an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or she communicates through conversations with others while at work or at home
34, In addition a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with others electronically via email or texting or Facebook
34, Students might also find examples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previous writing assignments
34, Second student writers can look for ideas from other people’s experiences
34, For instance writers can interview other students or even family members
34, Additionally a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class
34, For one thing Source would be television shows on the topic of communication
34, All in all college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment
34, On the whole lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills
34, As one can see a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; Moreover reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases
34, Finally college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments

34,Passionate PhotographerIt’s November 9th 2016 I woke up in the early morning 6:30 AM and thought of checking my e-mail
34, I was sleepy and rubbing my eyes to see the responses to my post in the job portal regarding part-time job in photography
34, My drowsiness flushed away after seeing a reply on my post I was happy to see the message “Joy I found your professionalism in Photography and your sample Images in the blog mesmerized me

34, You can describe the academic and social activities at your college and any unique aspects of your learning environment
34,It was my first day in MSIT
34, I don’t know any of the student till I stepped in to college
34, Their are many questions in my mind how to introduce myself and how the pattern of this college would be
34, Finally the day ended by introductions and filling the forms and submission of my certificates
34, Next day they told us to attend classes that night I felt alone because only two friends are known to me that to they are new
34, Next day IT section began and I found it to be very difficult and I am enable to understand Programming language because the programming is new to me
34, My mentor started topics day One itself
34, The pattern of the exam was to horrible that I got frighten by it
34,The Credits and timings were also uneasy to me that took long time to adjust to those
34,It was all new to methe city itself was new to me and SurrondingCollege environoment made me feel somewhat free from all the tensions I had after entering
34,Then I realized that always we don’t have easy ways to go on with life but we need to withstand with all the conditions in life
34, Never try to escape from those
34, So by self motivation I continued in this college
34, Even those would be hard situations to handle I thought to be ready to handle them and try to be satisfied with what I had
34, Their was a saying that “To succeed in your mission you must have single-minded devotion to your goal
34,”
35,PASSAGE TASK In the passageit is stated that the television appearances are of great benefit to the professors themselves as well as their university and general public
35,But the speaker questions of really getting benefited from it and disproves the passage statements
35, For the point in the passage that professors get high reputation on Tv’s as there are many people infront of tv when compared to the class room
35,The speaker in the lecture is refusing it by saying that the professor might lose the way of his profession like teaching in class rooms and conference halls
35, In passageit is stated that the public are benefitted by tv lectures and sharing knowledge by this type may increase their interest in that subject
35,But in the lectureshe refuses to accept by saying that tv’s are meant for entertainment and no one will be interested in watching tv after dinner
35, In the passageit is stated that the university gets good fame if the professor is seen in tv shows
35,But the speaker opposes it by saying that professor can spend the time in university about research or academics rather taking lot of time for preparing for TV shows
35, ESSAYTOPIC: Young people enjoy life more than other people do
35, I go with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do mainly because of less responsibilities at the younger age
35,Moreover they are energetic and ready take any sort of entertainment as they are well prepared for that at that age
35, And energy is must to enjoy the life to the extent
35,Older people may not feel well because they have suffer from different types of diseases at that age like back pain knee painsjoint pains
35,All they need is take rest at the age and take care of their childrenmoneyproperty etc
35, Because being old has many responsibilities when compared to children where as young people are free from responsibilities and they are free to enjoy the life
35, With the increase in agethe responsibilities increase and the enjoyment of the life decreases
35,For exampleat the younger agepeople go to schools and colleges 
35,They meet many new people and new friends as they go on become a graduate
35, Till then the parents take care of their expenses and economical related thing
35, Later on When they move on to the job they them self need to earn money as it is not good to ask parents for money and thus doing job is must
35,Right there the actual responsibility of a person starts 
35,He needs to earn money get married and then again taking care of children and cycle repeats
35, Once the college life or school life is done he doesnt have much time to enjoy the life as he has other responsibilities to do
35, In the conclusionthe enjoyment of the younger people is mainly sports and games
35,Which they can do better in younger age that older age
35,Morever as the increase in technologythe entertainment doubled as people started playing vide gameswatch videos onlinemovies etc
35,But the older people are not that aware of using technology and pass thei time as always by reading news paper and watching tv

35,TASK 1: WRITING Altruism is an unselfish act among humans and animals
35,Altruism is sacrificing something for others with nothing in return
35,Altruism is like sharing food shelter and donating blood organs to the family numbers and expecting nothing
35,By the altruism the person gets nothing but a good reward of generosity and a increases the self worth and a respect in the society
35,we can see many animals sacrificing their food for someone and also lives in some cases
35,One such example is meerkat
35,Meerkat dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa
35,In a group one meerkat acts as sentinel and protects others from predators when the groups go for food
35, When it sees a predator it will make an alarm cry for other meerkats to get formed in group or run away to save themselves
35,In this try it falls in more risk than others while trying to save their lives as it is alone and is more close to the predator
35,Thus this behaviour of meerkat which is called as altruism is helpful for their species to get saved from the predators
35,Contrasting points:The animals may be not aware of the danger that are caused by the altruism
35,So they are opting for it
35,Maybe sentinel is of full stomach before acting as a standing gaurdOr maybe it has a high chance to escape from predator as it sees first TASK 2: WRITING The topic was about some young adults wanting independence from the parents and some other to live with their parents for long time
35, We know how the young adults are developing these days with faster pace
35, And we can see the world also changing so fast
35, There is a need of developing the self confidence adaptability for the young adults to cope up with
35, One need some observation and guidance when is becoming an adult and needs to be supervised by someone because he may get mislead with his own ideas and do some notorious things
35, So the parents must be with him in that age to guide him through the better future and better life
35, So being under parent supervision and living with them for a long time is an acceptable statement
35, There is a chance of getting attracted to bad deeds when he is alone 
35,And his character reflects with the people in his surroundings
35, Living with parents make him to be more obedient and a fear for head of the family 
35,So there is less chance of getting attracted to bad deeds
35, Moreover being with family gives the person strength and a feel of security as there will be some unity among family members
35, When he faces any difficult situation or problem there are people who can correct him or suggest him when he lives with the family
35, In conclusion the person may get familiar with responsibilities towards his family members which in turn make him obedient self worth and increases his self respect
35, And his character reflects in the society that leads to a better nation
35, So living with the parents for a long time is a suggestible statement

35,ESSAY WRITING-1DON 2: The introduction scene of Don 2 starring Shah Rukh Khan is one of my favourite introduction scenes
35, At those times during the release of that movie people were very eager to watch the hero introduction from where it starts as this movie is a sequel of Don
35,In the scene the hero talks about the situation of the scene and the reason he is coming back again
35, The scene starts with ship sailing in the rivers of Africa
35, The hero stands there smoking a cigar with ultra stylish attitude
35, We’ll see the tattoo as “D” which means Don on his right hand and slowly to his eyes
35, That taking to show him slowly and increasing curiosity made me to like this scene
35,OOSARAVELLI: The Introduction scene of Oosaravelli movie is also one of my all time favourites in introduction scenes
35, The movie starts off on a high note with excellent introduction scene compared to the recent movies 
35,One of the friend’s of the hero introduces about the hero to the antagonist who came to enquire about him
35, The way he is introduced is perfectly nailed by describing his heart as a napoleon heart and his nerves as high tension wires
35, Where his whole body formation is started with skeleton and the body parts forming parallel to the description

35, We all have a wish to travel around the world or somewhere else
35,For mewish will be a smaller thing as I can say it as Wander lust! I have been to many places in India but that was not enough because many places left in my checklist
35,One such place is kerala
35, Kerala is also known as “God’s Own Country”
35, There are many reasons to support this statement
35, As kerala itself is seen as a synonym of beauty
35, The beauty of Kerala will be seen in long roads with coconut trees on the either side and greenery
35, Those beautiful scenes of Munnar hill stations will refute the above poem and make us feel lost in those scenic beauty and strongly support why it is called as God’s Own Country
35, While mentioning about Kerala one must mention about sea food available there on the sea shores
35, That sea food is largely exported in many parts of the world
35, Keralites love celebrating festivals 
35,Onam festival is celebrated in ostentatious way

35,What is the point ifthe student studying all the daygoing back home again opening the books and having no time to play sports
35, With increasing in school hoursthe home works must be made to be done within the school hours
35,so that the children can go the home with less burden and sepnd some time to play the sports
35,As children must play sports and should have a good sleepthey must be made free from the burdens of home work and studies
35,So increasing a hour in school and asking them to do all the home works and makes them free once they get to home
35, Schools should incorporate with extra curricular activities in the extra hours so that students who are interested in those activities can learn and participate
35,Extra period of sports is also suggestible in that extra period as they may get tired of studying all the day and that extra sports hour may make them feel refreshed

36,Firstlythe passage states that television experiences are of great benefit to the professorsbut the lecture putsdown this fact
36,It is told in the lecture that this is not good from a professors standpointbecause a Professor would become a part of entertainment rather than a professional
36,He would become a TV celebrity rather than a person who would do research in his lab
36,Secondly the passage states that the professor would become a celebrityforgetting the fact that he would confine himself to being a TV celebrity he would be busy preparing his presentation rather than improving his subject because TV networks give importance to his title and his material would be no better than a reporter who has done a little bit of homework

36, The young people enjoy their life more than the old people
36, They go where ever they want to go
36, They have their own parties weekends etc
36, The old people are very important to the younger generation because the young people are busy with their work
36, They don’t have time to take care of their children
36, In this situation the children have to be taken care of by their grand parents
36, They can sustain their life easily
36, Because the grandparents tell stories to their grandchildren
36, In those stories they say many good things about the persons and the behaviour with the elders and the other people

37,What is the importance of brick walls?Ans: Brick walls concept is to show the amount of will power you have got inside you
37, Brick walls are a form of negative motivation that tries to implement negative thoughts in your mind and prevent you from achieving your goals
37,What did Randy learn while pursuing to fulfil his second dream - that of playing in the National Football League?Ans: He learnt that learning the basics or fundamentals is a must while you are learning anything
37, Without the basics it is obvious that you will fail in the thing you want to excel

37, Though he didn’t make into the team he was glad that football has taught him the basics

37,How did Randy enable others to fulfil their childhood dreams?Ans: He worked on a project called Alice
37, The main aim of that project is to teach computer programming
37, He followed the logic of “best way to teach something is to having them to think something else
37,” Kids think that they are creating movies and games but in reality they are learning how to code and design
37, They are finding that interesting even though the work assigned to them is tough
37, In such way he fulfilled the dreams of others by teaching them how to code and design and achieve their goals via computer programming on a large scale!
37,If we draw the points from the lecture and compare them with the content in the passage the lecture strongly opposes the information given in the passage about meerkats
37, In the passage it says that One of the meerkats stands guard and watch out for the predators while the other meerkats might be busy hunting and eating the food
37,The sentinel meerkat which stands as the guard does not eat any food and it is prone to danger from the predators
37, Also it has to escape alone when a predator attacks after raising an alarm
37,The lecture opposes some of the facts mentioned in the passage
37, Such asThe sentinel meerkat which stands as the guard has the food first and then does its duty with a full stomachAlso the sentinel meerkat is the first one to know when a predator is attacking so it raises the alarm and hides in its burrow thus escaping from the predatorIt does not worry about the other meerkats which are busy in their own work
37,There are more similarities than differences in the case of human beings
37, Both the lecture and the passage state that humans get a little reward or personal pride after performing an altruistic act
37,Young adults as we all are very aware of are in the state of utter immaturity
37, They are in the state of mind in which they assume that they have the wisdom and knowledge to make their own decisions
37, These young adults are mainly in the age of 16 to 22
37, The idea of leaving their parent and home mainly depends on the parents’ upbringing
37, If they have brought up their kids in a well disciplined manner but in the wrong way the kids definitely might want to enjoy their independece as soon as possible
37, So parents’ upbringing also plays a critical role in shaping the minds of their children
37,Other adults who prefer to live with their families for a longer time tend to have lovely caring and affectionate bonding towards their family members and especially with their parents
37, Such adults are nurtured in the right way and they do not feel the importance or the necessity to leave their home in their current situation
37,I particularly feel that parents must make sure they provide independence to their children when they have come up to the age and also providing independence does not mean getting rid of them
37, Parents have to make sure that their kids are of the right age and ensure that they are taking care of their responsibilities or not
37, Nowadays students in the age group of age 16 to 22 are lacking worldly knowledge and are always addicted to the technology
37, I feel this is wrong because however that is not the life we have signed up for
37, Students must make sure that they have clarity in all aspects and must not regret after taking a decisionOverall I feel that young adults must spend more time with their families rather than leaving them at the age where they need us the most
37, However you are not going to live with your parents until the end of your life
37, Also parents need their children to be with them so that they can make the most of their lives in their last years
37, So spending more time with families gives us the utmost satisfaction
37, In the chase of achieving your goals you must never forget the persons who gave you a life to survive on this planet!One shining example I can provide is me
37, I felt engineering is the phase where all of us are adults and can make our own decisions
37, My parents provided me with lot more than independence; they have joined me in the hostel
37, On the very 1st day after my parents left me I got to know or rather felt the importance of staying with family and parents
37, So I used to go home on every weekend and spend the time with my parents which obviously were the best days of the week

37,Question 1A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie
37, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
37,MOVIE TITLE: TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (TNMT)WHY: The introduction scene of TNMT is just too good! It is a perfect way to open an action packed movie
37, The scene involves introducing the four ninja turtles one by one with their names and the skills they can perform being displayed beside the respective turtle and being portrayed by the turtle itself! The very next scene involves all the four turtles in a fight sequence showing off their skills
37, The main reason about me liking this scene is that the turtles’ sense of humour plays a crucial part in the film
37, They never react even during fights
37, They crack jokes in between themselves and defeats their opponents
37, Also they help among themselves and perform stunts which act as an attraction magnet in the film!Question 1:MOVIE TITLE: SHERLOCK HOLMESWHY:This movie has definitely one of the most fantastic opening scenes among all other movies
37, The characters in this movie are being portrayed by Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law
37, Robert Downey Jr portrays the role of Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as of Dr
37, Watson
37, The scene involves Sherlock and Watson saving a woman who is being crucified and tortured by Lord Blackwood
37, Blackwood would be performing black magic on the woman and Sherlock and Watson rescue her finally using their creativity and action skills
37, The most interesting part of this scene is where Sherlock detects a sharp instrument made of glass which is almost invisible to the eye and the way he helps Watson in not getting his eye pierced by the sharp object blows your mind! Overall this is one of the most exciting introduction scenes among the movies I have watched till now and I strongly recommend others to watch it too!Question 2The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
37, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
37, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
37, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
37,Essay:“School days needs to be Longer or Shorter?” This is the new rising debate in our school
37, It all depends on the students’ priorities
37, Some students may be good at studies and some at sports
37, So it is up to us to decide what is good and what must be prioritised for the good upbringing of the children
37, We cannot just implement this longer days daily as the students might feel stressed and may not be active at home and might not involve in any other activities
37, Also we all know how much we used to hate our school days when we were made to sit for such long hours at school
37, But the problem with shorter days is that some of the students are neglecting their studies in the excessive involvement of sports
37, These are the problems with both the shorter and longer days
37, I have an idea so that all the students get time to focus on their studies as well as sports
37, The idea is to implement the longer and shorter days on alternate days of the week
37, I strongly believe that we get better results from the students in sports and studies as well
37, I feel this is the best way to educate the children in both the fields

37,comSub: Plan of improvising the salesGood evening sirLately it has been difficult for us to cope up with other competing companies in the market
37, I have an idea which might help us to improve our sales
37, The idea is to increase the size of the outlet of the toothpaste tube so that customers will definitely apply more paste onto the brush
37, This way there is no need for us to increase the price and still can improve the sales because the customers will have to buy new ones as they will definitely use more if the outlet size is increased
37,If this idea works out then we can follow this more often so as to improve our sales all over the country

37,Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments
37,First they can draw on personal experiences
37, For examplefor an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or shecommunicates through conversations with others while at work or at home
37,In addition a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with otherselectronically via email or texting or Facebook
37, Students might also findexamples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previouswriting assignments
37, Second student writers can look for ideasfrom other people’s experiences
37, For instance writers can interview otherstudents or even family members
37, Additionally a writer may have heardothers talk about this topic maybe in class
37, Another source would betelevision shows on the topic of communication
37, Finally college writers mayfind that they need to do some research to complete an assignment
37, As one can seelots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills
37,All in all a search of “communication skills” on the internet mightprovide useful information; Moreover reference librarians can help studentsfind research materials in special collections or databases
37, On the whole college writersneed to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of othersand research materials to develop their written assignments

37,In a celebration party a photographer who was busy capturing photos of the people who were enjoying thoroughly in the party at night
37, Among the lot no one seemed to care for the photographer and none of them noticed the struggle he was facing all by himself as there was no other photographer
37, It was a birthday Aditya and all his friends are at the party to wish him and enjoy the birthday night
37, The photographer was a male student of some other college and of the same age as every other student present at the party
37, The name of the photographer is Kaushik

38, The cinematography was beyond excellent

38,Movie Title : Fight ClubFight Club was released in 1999 and was known for it’s bold and daring narrative

38,Summarization of the points in the lecture:A recent study about meerket has revealed some interesting points
38, Their eating habits in particular have got quite an attention
38, The meerket which stand guard seem to do their job only after eating a lot of food
38, Also they are the ones to see the predator first so they have a better chance of escaping by running into the burrows nearby
38, The scattered animals in the group searching for food are in greater danger
38, Also the warning calls might influence behavior that might draw attention for the predators
38,Talking about altruism in people humans perform various kinds of altruistic acts
38, For example donating kidney to a relative or a stranger and other such selfless acts
38, Although it’s a great sacrifice it receives appreciation and non material rewards for the donor
38,ESSAY:There is a growing culture in the youth to seek independence from parents
38, This sense of feeling comes from the desire to explore different possibilities and living life on their own terms
38, For example in the US there is a large percentage of people who are just over 18 years and want to be independent
38, They want to be away from family life and make money without being dependent on their parents
38, Also most of the students leave for various colleges and thus are independent
38,There is another case where people are attached to their familes and do not want to go off living life on their own
38, They love the atmosphere that is invoked when you are in the environment surrounded by your loved ones
38, They tend to be emotionally attached thus making it difficult to be alone and independent
38, For example 65% of the people in India still live with their own families
38, It is not exactly possible to single out a better way to live because it totally depends on the person’s perception of his life
38, So the people have to make a wise decision about how they are gonna live their life

38,SUMMARY OF THE VIDEOThe human voice it’s the instrument we all play with
38, It is the most powerful sound in the world but when few people speak they don’t have any listeners
38, The speaker points to the seven deadly sins which people tend to make when they speak
38, The foremost sin is gossip i
38,e speaking ill of someone
38, The second sin is judging
38, No one ever wants to listen when they are found wanted or someone is judging them
38, The next sin is negativity
38, It is hard to listen when someone is always talking negative stuff
38, The fourth sin is complaining
38, Complaining is thought of as viral and misery
38, The fifth sin is Excuses
38, When someone frequently resorts to excuses he is referred to as blame thrower
38, The penultimate sin is lying
38, Exaggeration out and out lying fall into this category
38, The final sin is dogmatism
38, It is hard to listen to people who frequently get confused with facts and try to convince others
38,The speaker then suggests the concept of HAIL
38, The general meaning of hail is to greet or acclaim enthusiastically
38, ‘H’ stands for honesty
38, ‘A’ stands for authenticity
38, ‘I’ stands for Integrity i
38,e standing by one’s word
38, ‘L’ stands for love
38, Here love refers to caring for people
38,The speaker then concludes by sharing the notion that sound should be created consciously and consumed consciously
38, It really is an idea worth spreading

38,When I was trolling some career websites this week I noticed that your company has a trot out for an intern this summer
38, The position sounds rad 
38, Can you shoot me back and email and tell me what’s up with the application process?When I was browsing through career websites this week I noticed that your company has an opening for an intern this summer
38, I think I would fit well into the position
38, So could you please mail me the details regarding the application process?
38,1Q) Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation?A)All large software development projects irrespective of application generate a large amount of associated documentation
38, For moderately sized systems the documentation will probably fill several filing cabinets; for large systems it may fill several rooms
38, A high proportion of software process costs is incurred in producing this documentation
38, Furthermore documentation errors and omissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption
38, Therefore managers and software engineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associated costs as to the development of the software itself
38,2Q) What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? A) 1
38, Process documentation - These documents record the process of development and maintenance
38, Plans schedules process quality documents and organizational and project standards are process documentation
38, 2
38, Product documentation - This documentation describes the product that is being developed
38, System documentation describes the product from the point of view of the engineers developing and maintaining the system; user documentation provides a product description that is oriented towards system users
38,3
38, System documentation includes all of the documents describing the system itself from the requirements specification to the final acceptance test plan
38, Documents describing the design implementation and testing of a system are essential if the program is to be understood and maintained
38, Like user documentation it is important that system documentation is structured with overviews leading the reader into more formal and detailed descriptions of each aspect of the system
38,3Q) What type of documents goes into process documentation?A) Process documentation falls into a number of categories: 1
38, Plans estimates and schedules - These are documents produced by managers which are used to predict and to control the software process
38, 2
38, Reports - These are documents which report how resources were used during the process of development
38, 3
38, Standards - These are documents which set out how the process is to be implemented
38, These may be developed from organizational national or international standards
38,4
38, Working papers - These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project
38, They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified
38, They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions
38, 5
38, Memos and electronic mail messages - These record the details of everyday communications between managers and development engineers
38,4Q) Why does process documentation become outdated frequently?A) The major characteristic of process documentation is that most of it becomes outdated
38, Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis
38, Progress will normally be reported weekly
38, Memos record thoughts ideas and intentions which change
38, Although of interest to software historians much of this process information is of little real use after it has gone out of date and there is not normally a need to preserve it after the system has been delivered
38, However there are some process documents that can be useful as the software evolves in response to new requirements
38,5Q) What is the role of working papers in software development?A) These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project
38, They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified
38, They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions

38,WRITING TASK 1The narrator in the lecture is not convinced that professors really benefit from doing TV shows
38, The passage says that professors acquire a lot of reputation among a much wider audience than compared to campus but the professors are not considered serious scholars from the standpoint of other professors
38, Also a lot of time gets wasted preparing for the TV show
38, They should ponder upon what to represent and also they have to spend time to look good in the show
38, The narrator suggests that all that wasted time could be used for research
38, It is mentioned in the passage that public gains from professor's appearing on television because they have a chance to learn from experts and get exposed to different views
38,The narrator questions if public truly benefit from such appearances
38, She explains that most of the TV networks don't care for in the in depth knowledge
38, All they require is the in depth topic
38, They focus on the deeper side of the current events and movie version of the great historical art themes
38, WRITING TASK 2It’s not necessary that younger people enjoy more than the older ones
38, It all depends on the perception of what gives you happiness
38, The common belief that younger people have more fun stems from the fact they like to hangout at coffee shops and are more prone to drinking and smoking than the older ones
38, Just because the older people don’t do all the above doesn’t mean they are not enjoying
38, Their idea of enjoying is too mature for the likes of the younger generation to understand
38,My dad for example enjoys life more than me
38, He is always willing to learn something new daily and that gives him happiness
38, He doesn’t depend upon external help for solving wide range of issues that keep popping up every day
38, He takes joy from all the underrated pleasures that life keeps offering to us
38, I on the other hand lead a very routine life
38, The packed schedule I go through every day doesn’t leave me with any moment to spare
38, In my shell life that I lead it would be an absolute crackerjack of a day if I had time to breathe
38, So relatively speaking I can say with utmost confidence that my dad enjoys life more than me
38,So it doesn’t really matter if you are young or old all that matters is the life you lead and your idea of enjoying life
38,
39,Task-1Altruism Each and every mammal on the earth will think of the survival of their group by taking risk in their life
39, Their behavior is totally unselfish and even nothing is gained by being altruism
39, Altruism means a behavior by sacrificing their interest and think of other’s
39, When we look at human beings some of them will donate eyes kidneys and blood; in reverse they don’t expect anything from the person who’s taking the parts
39, By being altruism they don’t think of themselves and will think of survival of another person
39, When it comes to animals for example meerkat present in Africa this is the animal which will look after the group of meerkat’s while in search of food
39, A group meerkat’s dwells in burrows in grassland search for the food and eat the food
39, Whereas one meerkat will be as a guard in front of the burrows and protects other meerkat’s
39, When there is any danger to the group it will raise an alarm by keeping its own life at risk
39, There is more risk for the meerkat which will be the guard because it should raise an alarm and it should think of safety
39, By this time the meerkat will be in more danger and has no chance to escape from danger
39, The meerkat which acts as guard will gain nothing and even does not get food for the time being
39, Meerkat sometimes may also die for the safety of other meerkat’s
39, This is the unselfish with scarifying their own interest
39, Task-2: According my opinion adults should be independent from their parents
39, When a child after reaching particular age they should be given independence they’ll get to know many things by their own
39, And even they’ll learn how to survive in the world
39, By depending on their parents some the adults are not knowing how to get into the world of individuality
39, And even some adults who depend on their parents do not know what to without them
39, One movie in Malayalam named ‘mili’ where role actress is totally dependent on her father and do not mingle with society
39, Even if the girl lost her job she has a confident that her father is going to push into other job
39, But at one particular time her father tried her to be independent
39, At that time the actor does not know what to do and tried to commit suicide
39, However in that movie with the help of another actor’s motivation she found her job by herself and made her father more proud
39, But when it comes to reality there is no chance for the person like ‘mili’ to get into new life and they try to end their life for no reason
39, When we look at other example there is a boy who depends on their parents and has a confidence that his father is going to push into any of the field
39, With that confidence that boy not even completed the graduation and free just passing the time
39, Even his sister has completed her graduation
39, For now he’s feeling ashamed and not getting another chance to prove himself
39, So I conclude saying that adults should be independent from parents but should have support from their parents
39, They should have confidence that they can achieve anything
39, Even if they lose anything also parent support should be there
39, Because of depression they may even commit suicide and end their life
39,
39,Task - 1Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation?Managers and software engineers should pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation because if any failures or any misleading data in the documentation will lead to errors by the end user
39, And they also lead to system failures which will crash the system and many installation costs are occurring
39,What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? Types of documents are:A document which acts like a barrier between the development team and member
39,System repository information which is used by maintenance engineers
39,The documents which are helpful for planning and scheduling the software development process
39,The documents which will help end user to use and administer the system
39,What type of documents goes into process documentation? Types of documents in process documentation:Plans estimates and schedules: These documents are used to predict and check the control of the software process
39, These documents are produced by managers
39,Reports: During the development these documents are used to report how resources are used
39,Standards: These documents are developed from organizational national or international standards
39, And these documents will give the process implementation
39,Working papers: The ideas and thoughts of engineers who are working on the project are recorded
39,Memos and electronic mail messages: The day-to-day communication between managers and team members is recorded
39,Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? The records which are there in the process documentation because they may change based on weekly fortnightly or monthly basis
39,What is the role of working papers in software development? The working papers are the principal technical documentations in a project

39,EssayYoung people enjoy life more than the older people do
39,In my opinion yes it is true: the young people enjoy life more than the older do
39, A few years ago these old people are the young people who enjoyed their life
39, When a person becomes old there will be more responsibilities and the person will be in the stage of earning
39, But when coming to young he/she will not have any responsibilities and he/she is dependent on the parents so there will be no restrictions
39,An old person has already crossed the young age has tasted the essence of enjoyment and will now have more and more responsibilities of the family
39, He/she will be having children and a partner and he will think more about the family rather than thinking of enjoying life
39, At the young age the people are free from the seriousness of life
39,The youngsters are easily addicted when he/she is habituated to enjoy in the life he’ll not think of anything
39, And moreover the youngsters have not experienced any struggles in the life
39, The older one will be employed and he is not free all the time to go out but when coming to young people there are no restrictions for them from parents and even from colleges
39, He/she is freer to do anything
39,So according to me the young people enjoy their life more than the older
39, But the old people are the one who came from their younger age enjoying
39,PassageIs Beneficial to Professors to appear on TV Shows?Points in Recording:Professors appearing in TV Shows may be beneficial but not all times
39,Some of the professors may come to TV show just to entertain people and they’ll provide any information
39, At this time the university may get down its reputation
39, The professors who are attending the TV shows are not calling for any university meetings academic discussions and some other important conferences
39,Professors they don’t even get money for doing researches they themselves should earn
39,A lot time is wasted for the professor because; when he/she is coming to the TV Show he should be well prepared
39, So he should have time to prepare time for rehearsal time to travel to the recording place
39,Even time is wasted for him/her to look good because he appears in front of many viewers
39,Although it is beneficial to universities but sometimes people will think that the professor is always giving TV Shows then when is teaching for the students
39,Already the material is available in many of the journals
39, Whatever he/she is presenting in the TV will not be more than the data available in journals
39,Points in Passage:The professors appearing on TV Shows will benefit more to the themselves even universities and also the general public
39,When a professor appears on television he acquires reputations in their academic fields and also among the audience
39,Whenever a professor publishes his views in a journal no one will be aware of that information
39, But whenever a professor appears on TV all the audience will improve knowledge and also people gain knowledge whoever are unaware of the topic
39,The audience who are impressed by the views of the professor will think about the college he is working
39, And by this way universities get benefited
39,Even the university will get more donations and applications from students
39,Even public will also gain knowledge from professors
39, Some people don’t know how to get their doubts clarified but if the topic is related to the TV show presentation then he/she will gain more knowledge
39,And his/her doubts will resolve for sometimes

40,Reading Passage tells about the advantages of University Professors being as a guest in Television
40, These Television appearances are great benefit to them as well as to their Universities but in the lecture professor tells us that there are disadvantages
40, Firstly it is not good for professor to be on Television
40, Whenever a professor appears on Television his reputaion among other professors will decrease
40,Professors are rated according to their academic excellence and their research papers
40, Secondly it is a waste of time being on Television because students who are under respective professors will get effected in their academics
40, If a professor is away from students then he get a bad reputation
40,In the reading passage it is quite opposite what was said in the lecture
40, They've mentioined that being as a guest in televison will help the professors in many ways
40, Ofcourse professors can explain everything on tv but it lacks the practicality of the work
40, TV reporters can explain the same thing whatever the professors gonna say then there is no need of professors for that
40, People get benifitted form those lectures but they cannot attain complete knowledge
40, Professors should maintain some dignity in the society as they will provide foundation to their students and gain good reputaion in the society
40, TV is to entertain whereas University professors are there to enhance the tought process
40,
40,Eventhough young people are more outgoing than older people I don't agree with the statement
40, Old aged persons are mostly retired and have more time to go on trip and travels but young people do not have more time to travel
40, Because young people are busy with their proffession but they are more interested to go out and make new experiences
40, In comparison older people already have a lot of experience and they often just want to visite places where they have been before rather than go on exciting trips
40,However older peole often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as flexible as young people are
40, Older people are more interested in their own family which is often the most important topic in their lives
40, And to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into discos and stay up all night what a lot of younger people do
40,To sum up the main points I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do because there are so many things that older people can do which younger can not do
40, To my opinion older people enjoy their lifes different than younger people do but there is no better way

40,Young adults are the people who are going to flourish the country with great inventions and entrepreneurship abilities
40, There is a situation where if an individual of young age is having all comforts needed and having a high pay profile job will think like they want to be independent person
40, Well actually that’s a pretty good decision to have but when you come out to be an independent person of there are some good things and bad things you’ll have to face
40, One of the thing is like you will be out of emotional bonding with your parents
40,These kind of independent nature people are seen mostly in USA and UK but in India that’s not the case
40, Here in India parents will play a crucial role in development of their child’s growth in terms of Education Public Speaking Helping others Being a role model in the society
40, This envisages the child to get connected to the real life lessons at early age
40, Those seeds which are sown at early ages will be applied in their life at young age

40, These things you won’t
41,Q1)1
41,The reading and the lecture discuss this issue
41, In the reading paragraph it is said that the professors appearing on television is good for themselves for the university where they work and for the public because by this it will get good reputation to the professor as well as the university
41, But the lecture disagrees with this opinion because the lecture says that if professors participate on TV programs it actually effects their reputation since the people consider they are not serious about the doing research and they are more concerned about entertainment than academic issues and reading is exactly opposite to the lecture it said doing so the professors are viewed as authorities in the subject
41,2
41, The lecturer also disagrees with reading that the public gains from professor appearing on TV
41, He said that the television is doing this programs to get publicity and not for providing knowledge to the people
41, So the information delivery is not different from something delivered from a reporter that has made she or he home work and people will become more conscious on their appearance of him/her in tv rather than the lecture and the lecture says that appearing on TV takes time from the professor to prepare what he or she have to present on the TV and the time will also be wasted in travelling
41, This time that could be used by the professor to attend students or doing research for example
41, But the reading says that when professors appear on TV the public or children has the chance of learning from experts by listening to their lectures and the passages also says that the appearance of professors on TV can bring publicity to the university so it increases donations student applications and it also increases reputation to professors and there is also chance of getting good research opportunities
41, Q2) Young people enjoy life more than old people do?Yes according to me i totally agree to the above statement that “young people enjoy life more than old people do” because younger people have much more energy passion to do things and they will have very less responsibilities compared to the older people and i have also seen the old people who were unable to enjoy their lives and they remain sad for enjoying their lives as we do
41, For example my grandfather who has to take care of his family and he had to earn money to he has to maintain family
41, The technology has also become an important thing in our life as a part of the enjoyment
41, For example we are using social media applications like whatsapp and facebook and many other apps to connect people and we can also go out and enjoy the late nights
41, But older people can only connect with their friend with traditional method which is only couple friends with some boundaries and most of the people are unable to use the technologies which this generation are using
41, So that is why i think that young people can able to enjoy life by being less responsible more energetic and more following up new things

41,TASK 1:Q)summarize the points made in the lecture being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passageAns: Altruism is type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that animal or group of animals 
41,Altruism is the opposite of selfishness; individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves
41,The best example of altruism is humans and other mammals
41, Unselfish acts of the human being like helping others sharing the food or other things with other people with others but they are not given any rewards the people share their belongings even with the strangers
41, In many cases we can see sharing food in common with both humans and other mammals
41, The human beings are also sacrificing their body organs for the family members for example kidneys but by doing this they don't get any advantage or rewards it's just sacrificing
41, There is another example of meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained
41, if the meerkat sees a predator approach it gives an alarm or cry alert to other meerkats to run and seek the shelter but the meerkat do not guard unless they complete their eating
41, so the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat group
41,TASK 2:Q)some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible
41, other young adults prefer to live with their parents for a longer time
41, which situation do you think is better ?Ans: The young adults should have both the independence and they should be under the family for longer time because if the young adults are given more independence there is a chance of misusing the freedom 
41, But most of the young adults feel that they should have some freedom but according to me the young adults should be under the guidance of parents because at that age the children will not get fully matured so it is better for young adults to stay under their guidance and by doing this we can also know how to behave and how to mingle with the society 
41,This makes young adults a better adult
41, But i feel that young adults should also have independence because if the young adults are restricted they may get mentally disturbed and they may not be able to live in the society effectively and for example my parents have given me freedom of choice in going to higher studies or job likewise every adult should be given independence to do what they want to do
41, so it's better to have independence under parents so that there is no chance of misusing the freedom as well as they will also get to know how to grow into a better person

44, Two men follows her to kill that baby but surprisingly that lady kills the two men following her
44, Later her leg is slipped while she is walking and falls in a river and is sunk in the river but she saves the baby by lifting him with his hand
44, After watching that scene I was excited like anything with some doubts
44, They are who is that woman and why those two men are following that lady and want to kill the baby
44, Moreover why is she trying to save that baby
44, With all of these questions I was very much excited
44,MOVIE TITLE: WHY: I like the introduction scene of Magadheera very much
44, The scene was a couple of lovers were fallen down from a big mountain for the sake of their love and a man looking like a king cremated the crown of the man(one of the lovers)
44, By watching this movie I was confused with a lot of questions like who were the lovers? what was happened before that introduction scene? why they both were felled down themselves
44, With all of these questions I was very much excited
44, So this excitement makes me to like that introduction scene
44,Question 2: Favourite placeIf I have a vacation to go anywhere in this world then I will go to Taj Mahal one of the seven wonders of the world situated in Agra
44, As the name indicates the Taj Mahal is like a Raj mahal
44, Taj Mahal was built by an moghal emperor named Shah Jahan
44, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a memory of his wife Muntaj
44, Moreover the name Taj Mahal was derived from the name of Muntaj
44, Everyone in their life should visit Taj Mahal atleast once
44, Taj Mahal was built in 1638 by Shah Jahan
44, It was built with an ivory marble which is white in colour
44, Because of its colour Taj Mahal very much attracts the tourist people who is coming from all over the world
44, Not only Indian people but people from other countries also come to Agra to see the Taj Mahal
44, 7-8 million people come from all over the indis to visit the Taj Mahal
44, The Taj Mahal has a beautiful and big garden around it which attracts the people most
44, There is a river called Yamuna which is flowing beside the Taj Mahal
44, Though the pollutants from the river Yamuna are polluting the marble of the Taj Mahal it is stll looks very much attractive and looking like white palace

44, LONGER SCHOOL DAYNow a days not only education makes the students perfect but sports also make better
44, In today’s world students are studying well and at the same time they are undergoing much stress because of their studies at that time sports may help them to get relax
44, The longer school day will not help the students in achieving their goals because education alone doesn’t satisfy the students
44, Moreover there should be equal importance for studies and education in the students life in order to get success
44, Not only education helps the students in getting jobs but there are some jobs which are given to sports persons also
44, If there is a longer school day students may not concentrate on just only on studies
44, There should be exercises for students in order to increase their concentration
44, As researches told students playing sports are more healthier that the students who are not playing and just concentrating only in studies
44, So we should give equal importance for studies and sports
44, Therefore it is better to not implement the longer school day
44, As the students can’t concentrate on studies if they are studying 24 hours some of the time should be allocated to sports and exercises
44, So keeping the above points in consideration please do not implement the longer school day

44,TASK-1How the lecture opposes some points given in the passageIn the lecture the person explains about altruistic nature of the some of the living species such as humans animals
44, In the paragraph it is explained that animals sacrifice their own interests and even life for the sake of others
44, For example mammals like meerkats which lives in groups has a senitel meerkat
44, What that senitel meerkat does is it acts as a safeguard to the members of group and saves the group while other members go to hunt and eat food
44, If any predator comes near by the group first the senitel meerkat makes an alarming cry so that all the rest go to their shelters or form in a group
44, The points that were opposed by the speaker from the passage is that in the passage the altruistic nature can be seen in animals only like mammals
44, But the speaker tells about the altruistic nature of humans also since many humans sacrifice food and body organs for their relatives some times for others
44, So in this way humans also have altruistic nature as well as animals TASK-2Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible
44, Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time
44, Which of these situations do you think is better In my point of view living with parents is better rather than getting freedom from them because parents are the only care takers of us in the entire universe
44, So living with them helps us in many ways
44, If we want to freedom means you are avoiding them which is not the correct thing because they may miss us and they want you with us
44, if you want freedom even you also sometimes feel lonely ness
44, If we want independence we can get if for some time but independence or freedom for a long time is not a good idea
44, Seeking independence may lead to the negative impression on us in the parents
44, So finally what I want to say is that living with parents is more better than seeking independence from them
44,
44,TASK1The human voice that’s the instrument we all play
44, It is the most powerful sound in the world probably
44, It is the only one that can start a war or say “I love you”
44, He(The author) is not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large habits that we can all fall into
44,First gossip  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present
44, Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us
44,Second judging
44, We know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same timeinutes later will be gossiping about us
44,Third negativity
44, You can fall into this
44, My mother in the last years of her life became very negative and it's hard to listen
44,And finally volume
44, We can get really excited by using volume
44, Sorry about that if I startled anybody
44, Or we can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet
44, Some people broadcast the whole time
44, Try not to do that
44, That's called sodcasting
44,Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately
44, Not nice

44,Writing SectionTASK -1Normally professors are found in universities libraries and class rooms giving lectures to the students
44, However some professors gives lecture on television
44, By doing so they can get authority on the topics on which they gave the lecture
44, By giving lecture in television the importance of the professor will be enhanced
44, The professor contradicts the points given in the passage in many ways
44, They are discussed below
44, In the lecture the professor explained about whether the lectures given by some professors are really useful i
44,e
44, whether does anybody get benefitted by those lecture? The professor in the lecture said that many professors gave lecture on television just for entertainment not to educate the general public or students
44, The television channels just think about their ratings and they do not encourage real scholars to give lectures on their channels but they want professors who can entertain the audience well
44, The professor in the lecture also said that when the professors are giving lectures on the television they are not available for the students to clarify their doubts
44, It is also be disadvantageous also for the professors giving the lectures on television because to give the lectures on television the professor do make up for him and also he want to make notes of that lecture
44, This all are the time waste process
44, During this time the professor might do research on a topic
44, The professor also said that to give lectures on television great scholar is not required anybody who can make notes can give lecture on TV
44, TASK-2Young people enjoy more than older peopleIn my opinion young people enjoy more than older people in many ways
44, Young people have many advantages to enjoy rather than older people
44, Older people cannot go outside alone because at that age they may have several problems like B
44,P sugar and some other problems
44, For example young people can go to a movie and enjoy the film in the case of older people it is different why because many of the older people have eye sight and they cannot watch the movie not only the movie they cannot enjoy the nature also
44, In other case many of the old people do have sugar so they do not eat sweets like young people
44, Old people cannot run and play like young people because at that age their body does not support them to play
44, Nowadays people who got the age of 60 cannot enjoy like young people
44, Older people cannot do adventures like older people because older people does not have the body fitness like young people
44, Older people does not get a chance to many participate in many events unlike young people
44, Some of the events are like dancing playing
44,
45,Altruism is a type of behaviour or mentality of a particular individual who sacrifices his/her own comforts for the existence of his fellow beings
45, In case of animals sometimes people generally misunderstand the behaviour of these animals let us take an example of the meerkat found in the grasslands of Africa it acts as stand guard and gives an alarm cry to the group whenever a predator like a hawk is seen approaching to any general analysis this would appear to be like an act of selflessness or altruism but the meerkat is actually safeguarding itself and by giving the alarm call the meerkat is diverting the attention of the predator Coming to human beings known as social animals altruism is considered as the main difference between animals and human beings but there is still a selfish motive related to the altruistic nature they show but the benefits are almost immaterial so though there is a slight difference between humans and the animals the point to be noticed is they expect something in return
45,Independence Children are cared taught and are loved the most by the parents right from their birth to a certain age that is when they become majors or enter the adulthood but now a days there is a concept which is mostly prevalent in the western countries and is also slowly entering Asia
45, The western world has always followed this concept which is once the child is major he or she should be in a position to earn their own bread this thing automatically disconnects most of the things which the children were earlier attached to their parents so sometimes children out of peer pressure or due to the attraction of this new world they are about see in a few years start seeking it even more earlier this way of thinking is actually an external ideology this is not an internal process of ideas so I disagree with teenagers who want freedom and put do not disturb sign boards on their bedroom doors
45,Where as in the other part of this world children even after growing old enough still depend on their parents this is can be understood as taking for sure as if someone would work for them 
45,My side is that children should openly share their pressures and failures with their parents to get help but having independence in an immature state of mind is not a good decision and the same with the second case children try to depend on their parents even after growing old enough
45, I believe that children should be with their parents till they grow old enough to make decisions on their own

45,Starting with the positive points of a professor appearing on TV a professor gains huge reputation among his fellow professors and also among the common folks which in turn brings the university Large amount of donations and also it can be useful for their potential students
45,It also provides the common audience with required basic information about a particular topic 
45,There are also very important cons towards this commercialism for an university professor
45,an university professor is expected to do research or meet students are probably teaching which is considered to be very productive work for any professor to do but if he/she spends his/her time on these kind of fancy stuff then there productive time is being spend in an unproductive way this is because no TV show is going to deal any topic in depth and there is no need for a [professor who deals with subjects in depth to explain it on TVfor that matter any TV reporter if a good homework is done can easily reproduce that matter for the audience
45, The most important drawback for those professors who actually participate in these TV shows is they will not be invited for big discussions on a particular subject when all the experts come to discuss on the topic which is a very bad for their professional carer
45,from both the sources of information a conclusion can be drawn that professors are the most dedicated professionals in the society and they are expected to have a great social responsibility by being commercial and dreaming of popularity a professor might loose his very essence of his profession
45, The phrase is an open ended question so let us deal with it using a simple analysis
45,every human passes through both the stages of the life when a person is young he is free from responsibilities and is just responsible for himself he is not bored of any routine stuff he is free to chose his careerhis favorite food clothesBecause in youth every one has only one motive that is “am I happy today ?”so one can draw a conclusion from this analysis that people tend to be happy in their youth rather than their old-agethis is because a man’s thought becomes actions and his actions behavior so the whole lifestyle of any youngster is to enjoy
45, Nevertheless it depends on the economic and the family conditions of the individual
45,People in the old age have every right to enjoy and live their life because they faced three fourth of their life and struggled to get to that position but they have their limitations like health issueslow energy levels even they have money and freedom to enjoy their lives but because of the limitations they just relax but it again depends totally on the individual some are very young in their attitude and blood they are still 20 at 60 they take risks to just enjoy
45,So by the analysis that is been done in the above two passages we conclude that youngsters or old people both of them have thorns which keep on choking them through out our lives but it is only the attitude that matters not the age
45,
46,They are opposing because of these specific reasons
46, First if the professors are concentrating on television shows they can’t spend more time on research
46, If professors spend more time in research then can find new things
46, Sometimes they may not get resources for their research if they spend more time on television appearances
46, Scholars and research fellows may not get proper guidance for their research
46, Universities can’t get reputation if there is no professor to teach the students
46, Professors have to conduct more number conferences and works shops in research field this gives encouragement to young students and they become scientists
46, They have to share their ideas with the students and they have to publish their journals and research work
46, To do all these things professors have to spend more time on their work and they have to lot of work
46, So finally appearing on TV shows is not good for professors
46, Young people enjoy life more than older people doI agree with this statement because of the following reasons
46,When we are young we don’t care about money and our responsibility about family burdens
46, We only take care about ourselves friends games movies girlfriends and boyfriends
46, When we are young we know only how to spend money and how to enjoy but when we started earning money then we will know how our parents faced difficulties while they were earning money
46, Parents always bother about their child but children never bother about parents
46, When we are young our parents will take care about our health our schooling our food and everything about us
46, So young people enjoy life as parents giving anything they want
46,On the other side older people can’t enjoy the life as young people can do
46, Why because they have so many responsibilities about their family and their work
46, They have to maintain the family and they have to make the money
46, Older people don’t have that much of energy as younger people have
46, Even though have to work for the family because it’s their responsibility
46, Finally I can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do

47,RollNo:IH201685047Writing based on experience and knowledge:Young people do enjoy their lives more when compared to old people to some extent why because people at an early age don't have much responsibilities regarding family issuesjobexpenditure and so on whereas when people grow-up the responsibilities incerases in such a manner that they have to look after their familyjobexpenditurehealth and everything
47,So as people grow-up they spent most of the time to undertake their responsibilities rather than enjoying their individual life
47,So old people do enjoy their lives that is their enjoyment lies in making their family happier but young people have their own individual enjoyment
47,This is one reason to say that young people enjoy life more than older people
47, On the other hand there are some people who are born for enjoyment
47,They find enjoyment in every aspect of their life irrespective of their ages
47,Even though young people may not have responsibilities regarding familyjob and expenditure but they do have responsibilities regarding their education
47,But in education along with learning they find enjoyment in setting their career dreams and get them done
47,In our lives we meet many new friendschill out with friends for moviesshopping at weekendsshare our thoughts where we find enjoyment
47,So people at an early age enjoy their lives in fulfilling their own dreamsand when they grows-up they find their enjoyment in fulfilling their responsibilities to their family
47, I hereby conclude that whatever age you are at you should try to enjoy your life
47,Success and failures are common in everyones life
47,Even if we fail in any of the aspects one should try to learn from that experience so that you can use the things you learned by which you can succeed
47,So try to be positive and enjoy your life as much as you can irrespective of your ages
47,Writing based on reading:When professors appear on television they themselvesalong with their universities and general public gets benefited why because they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields in a wider way than they have on campus
47,If a professor publishes views in an academic journalonly a few will learn about and appreciate those views whereas when a professor appears on TVthousands of people outside the narrow academic community will view those ideas therby the professor's importance will enhance
47,Also when the professor appears on television the universities also benefit as people see a knowledgable faculty member of university and they think high about the university to which the professor belongs
47,This reputation in turn leads to more donations for the university and more applications from potential students
47,Finallythe public who have no chance to learn from experts gets exposed to multiple new ideas otherwise by which they never hear about
47,The viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight
47,Writing based on listening:If professors appear on television it wastes lot of their time in preparing what to presenttime to traveltime to get ready and to get the show shooting done
47,Instead of wasting his time he can spend his time on research so that he can grow in his career
47,Also the television networks want the professors to discuss academic titles but not intellectual subjects
47,So public can get that academic titles from television editor rather than watching his lecture on television which would be of no use

47,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifies its own interest for that of another animal or group of animalswhich is opposite of selfishness and individuals performing altruistis acts gain nothing for themselves
47,Coming to the point of altruism of in mammals namely meerkatsIn the passage it is mentioned that meerkatwhich is a mammal acts as a senitalstanding guard and looking out for predators such as hawk which approaches the groupit gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats in the group to run and sheek shelter and by standing guard it gains nothing that is it goes without food while others eatand it places itselt in grave danger while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained
47,According to the audio it is mentioned that meerkats eat before they act as a standing guard and they stand near the burrows while alarming so that they can readily escape from any of the predators
47,Also there is a chance that predators can find where did the alarm come from and easily trace the place in which the meerkats are present Coming to the point of altruism of in mammals namely meerkatsIn the passage it is mentioned that humans altruistis acts ranges from sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members and even to strangers where the one who is performing the acts gains nothing yet they are provided with little reward to the one performing the actAccording to the audio it is questioned whether the people who are performing this altuistic act are really appreciatedand if those people are really appreciated it leads to the increase of self worth Family relationship is the strongest relationship than any other relationships in the world
47,As per my opinion the young adults who prefer s to live with their families for long time is better when compared to the young adults who want independence from their parents as soon as possible
47,Being a young adult you might not be having much experience in solving critical problems so if you live with your family you will be receiving total support in any of the aspects as they are much experienced in all these problems in their life
47,As you need the support of your family at your young agethey too need your support when are grown-up
47,Our parents sacrifice their whole life in earning money and providing us everything from basic needs like food clothingshelter to education
47,They even starve for us because our lives are important for them than theirs
47,So it is our minimum responsibility to look after them when we are grown-up
47,If you have a good family relationship you can be very confident even in your worst cases as they supportmotivate and boost-up your levels
47,In olden days when the joint families are high in number the rate of divorce after marriage is very low but now where the joint families are rare to find the rate of divorce after marriage is very high
47,It is not that being in a joint family or not is the only reason for the growth rate of divorce but what I mean to convey is being with your family will be an added advantage because they can guide youteach life lessons from their experiencesmotivate you when you are depressed and short-tempered
47,In this modern world because of their career and job it is not possible for everyone to stay with their families but inspite of all your busy schedule you should spend a minimum of ten minutes a day to talk to your family over phone and also make a chance of visiting your home now and then whenever time permits
47,If you are good at your parents then your child will be good at you in future as they learn lessons from you

47,He was invited for a wedding reception to make photography
47,When he reached the wedding ceremony he was very much impressed by the location as the surroundings are well-decorated with beautiful flowers
47,He was allotted a room to place all his photography stuff like lightslenscamerasbags etc
47, After placing the spare things in that room he went to the stage to capture a few pictures and check whether the lens are suitable for the photography
47,As he was not satisfied with the clarity he went back to his room to change the lens which are more appropriate to the brighter light
47, When he was walking along the corridorhe heard a noisy sound from one of the rooms and he paused infront of the room
47,He started to stare into the room through window and found that there was a fight going on between two people namely Kelvin and Karan regarding some issue
47,After some time the two people behind the closed doors observed that someone is listening to their conversation
47,They came out and warned him to keep their conversation under his hat
47,But as the photographer has a blabber mouthit was difficult for him not to react to the situation
47,He was back to the photography and for every five minutes he was trying to say something to his assistant photographer but being ceased very time
47,He tried to byte his tongue but at last he was unable to control himself and let the cat out of the bag
47,The secret is that Kelvin(the father of bride) is fighting with Karan(the father of bridegroom) regarding dowry
47,Kelvin is ready to give five hundered and thousand rupee notes as he is in a critical position to get hundred rupee notes in exchange of them
47,ButKaran being an intelligent fellow is not at all ready to accept five hundered and thousand rupee notes as they are baned

47,It was June 132016
47,Early in the morning I woke up at 6:00 am in the morning
47, It was the deciding day of my career because I got a mail stating that I am short listed to attend an IELTS exam followed by counselling through which I can secure seat in MSIT which would provide me a chance to be a student of IIITH
47,I started at 11:am from home and it took 2 hours to reach the place where I have to attend for the counseling session
47,After reaching there I am informed that there is no IELTS exam and I can directly attend for the process of counselling
47, By hearing the news I got relaxed to some extent
47, There are only 160 seats in IIITH where the competitors are too high
47, Even though MSIT course is offered in some other universities like JNTUHJNTUKJNTUA majority of the students are willing to take the course in IIITH as it is one of the most prestigious institutions in our country
47, We are asked to sit in a hall where all the students and parents gathered there
47, After some time I started to interact with the other students and when I asked a few students about their scores and the range of their scores is 1500-1800 out of 2400
47,My score was 1535 in GAT and I am very tensed thinking whether I could secure a seat in IIITH or not
47, Even though if I miss IIITH I know that I would definitely secure a seat in JNTUH but still I was tensed because IIIT is an international institution and being a part of these kind of institutions could be a dream for every student
47, After some time we are called for certificate verification and after completing that there was a presentation in which they provided all the details about the course durationrules and regulationsfee structure and lot more
47, Then we are asked to attend a face to face interview in which I was asked to selected select the institution in which I want to take the course
47, I answered “Sir I obviously choose IIIT as it is one of the most reputed institutions”
47, The interviewer was calm for a few seconds and I am tensed
47, The next minute I heared a voice saying that “Congratulations mam!You got a seat in IIIT”
47, When he said that news there are no limits for my happiness and I am very excited
47, In this way the typical day ended with the happiest news

48,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal or a mammal sacrifices for that of others
48, It is an opposite of selfishness
48, Individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves
48, Example of altruism among both human and animals is sharing and donating
48, We may donate our organs to people who are in need
48, We also share our food with the strangers just because of altruism
48, Such acts are altruistic since it benefits others
48, In spite many animals are willing to sacrifice food or even their life for the members of their group
48, Old age homes education to poor children pet homes etc are the examples of things done by altruists
48, Altruists expect nothing from others and helps people with having any beneficials
48, Altruists may or may not be educated but they have kind heart to help others which is the greatest qualification ever
48, In a simple terminology altruism is unselfishness
48, Altruism is a part of life
48, Sharing our energy with other people and showing compassion towards humans and even animals can lead to happiness
48, It’s like a straightforward bridge from altruism to happiness
48, Now a days people are busy with their own lives
48, Every one need their own life and they have no time to spend even with their family
48, Today's youth is developing at a very faster pace
48, It is required for everyone to be a self dependent obedient knowledgeable person otherwise it is difficult to stand in such a competitive market
48, But to have such type of qualities foremost important thing for an adult is to be respectful obedient and firm which can only develop if young adults live with their families for a longer time
48, However if adults want to live independent then rather than becoming talented they become harsh notorious because in the developing stages it is required for an adult to live under observation of their parents otherwise they will definitely get involved in some bad deeds
48, To begin with if an adult is young or we can say that in a developing stage then it is required for him to live under observation
48, This is required because the behavior of an adult in the developing stage changes according to surroundings it is difficult for him to change that behavior in older stages
48, If in developing stage adults live with their family then they will definitely teach him about obedience
48, Parents also teach the adult that how to give respect to others
48, But at the same time if in developing stage adult isolated from their parents then it is difficult for him to understand obedience and it could be a possibility that adult get involved in some bad deeds like drug addiction etc
48, which makes impossible for an adult to be a self dependent person
48, In conclusion it is required for young adults to familiarize themselves with the responsibilities they has towards their families which will only occur if they live with parents for longer times
48, This helps children’s to be an obedient respectful and independent person
48, It is undeniable that society accepts only obedient and self independent person which indirectly helps in the development of the nation
48, For example because of many reasons whatever it might be old age homes are becoming the source for many parents
48, It's not the right way of treating them
48, When parents become old it is the time when we should take care of them and be a support for them

48,He learned fundamentals and he said that “when you’re screwing up and nobody’s saying anything to you anymore that means they gave up” and that’s a lesson that stuck with him throughout whole life

48,The passage explains about professors
48, The main concept is about professors appearance on television
48, Professor the person who teaches at college level
48, Mostly professors teach in college but they sometimes appear on television
48, Most of the people says that they appear on television because they have many benefits
48, They acquires the reputation as authorities with many number of audience than they have at college level
48, They also says that when professor appears on television their importance is enhanced
48, Not only the professors the universities also get benefitted by that in case of more donations because of most knowledgeable professor
48, They also states that professors who are appearing on televisions are mostly to earn money
48, They make more entertainment that teaching
48, It is also a time consuming processing because doing rehearsal’s before attending the program and travelling is a loss of time
48, Instead of doing this they can go for research which is very useful to them
48, The appearance of a professor in television also became a business for universities since they are earning money
48,
48,Young people enjoy life more than old people do
48,I agree with the above statement
48, Firstly I state that if a person have a lovable parents he is he most happiest person and enjoys a lot in his younger stages
48,Coming to other reasons now a days people are not so efficient as in past due to more amount of unhealthy food consumption in day to day life
48, In past the quality in food is much better than now a days and the people are very healthy even they become old in those days
48, But now a days most of the people are becoming old mostly at 60 years of age and so people enjoy their life at their younger stages only
48,Younger ones are more energetic and active compared to older ones
48, So young people have more active participation than old people
48, They actively participate in games and other cultural activities and education is the place where they mostly learn everything and also enjoy their life
48, Young people also had an active participation in travelling different places and experiencing different types of enjoyments which include games such as rollercoaster water rides gokating car races and many other
48, In this cases the old people don’t have much interest and they miss their enjoyment
48,Also young people enjoy their life during their school days and college days
48, It is the time where they learn lot of things and participate in many things and will have the most memorable days of their life
48,Finally the main reason for the younger ones to enjoy a lot is friends
48, Friendship is the greatest gift of god since friends are the one who encourages us and stand by us in difficult situations
48,So by efficient examples I state that Young people enjoy life more than the old people do

48,Magadheera : In the year 1609 AD Aravali Mountains at a place called Bhairava Kona

48, And then skipping 400 years to the year 2009 AD we see that a person with similar features to Bhairava coming alive
48, This is actually a very great introduction

48, It was a clear explanation of where the story started and the time when it happened
48, It also has explains what happens to the characters

48, And the part where the sword goes down into the ground is quite leaves a question to the audience

48, The School board should implement a longer school day but it should include both education and extra-curricular activities
48, The school day should be longer because students need to prepare for higher education

50, I get into a new college life that was exposed to a different life style in learning and met all new people
50, As soon as I enter the college campus I thought the high school life was over and a serious time of life began
50,              By entering I have seen a big parking place I got to feel that I was entering a big institution
50, I entered the college and started asking people to help me in finding my class
50, I walked down the main walkway and was amazed at the size of a college library
50, People were studying with their books
50, I felt like I had entered a world of study
50, I walked into a big open place in which contains video games indore sports and chairs
50, People were eating playing video games and doing their works then soon I understood that it was canteen
50, Finally I approach a student and he showed me my classroom number in the register book
50, He told me to follow him because he also studies in same class
50, I found my seat and sat down
50, The looks of the classrooms at BVRIT College are awesome and the organization of the classrooms was different from the classrooms in high school
50, The first-week experience have been filled with too many emotions to recall
50, Hearing student’s talk about the workload scared the hell out of me
50, After five days my worries have died down but something embarrassing has just happened which underlying truths to the perceptions that worried me before I left for college
50,
50,Task-1: Humanity in person represents the character
50, In such a way that altruism is a type of behaviour which forfeits their interests to strangers and family members for their own gain or benefit to others
50, The person who is acting with the altruism will be rewarded
50, Even some animals like meerkat may also going to perform altruism for other animals
50, Some persons may act like they willing to perform this act or they are been help by some other altruism
50, The people will also act like guard and look for other predators while intend to grab the food or the food which is obtained
50, These meerkats will make an alarm for intimation to remaining to run and seek shelter and after if they see predator left again intimating to others that feel free
50, Similar to this if the humanity of a person be in a stability manner then the others will also survive with the altruism
50, For example if a person helps guy who is in need will willing to be feel free of mind from the next minute
50,Task-2:Today most of the people vary with one another that to be independent or to stay with parents because of the growth of current humanity and exposure from each other
50, For some particular reasons like strong rules by parents that which are not be likely for exam one of my friend want to go for outstation and the parents told not to go because of their fear that if anything happens towards their son but the son takes these words as unconstructive and fells like to be independent from parents
50, Some of them want to be independent because of their needs and for their future scope or because of their harsh reasons from their parents
50, According to me as I want to stay with my parents because of their care and intension to make me stand by my own in the future
50, For example as I stayed with my parents since childhood as they gave me a lot and while doing graduation I thought to go for abroad for my higher studies they supported me a lot to g
50, I make all my arrangements to leave them for my own purpose but when I reconcile all my past I have decided stay here with them and taking care
50, This example defines how they care about their sons/daughters and decided to they with parents for rest of the life
50,Thus from above reasons I conclude that it’s better to be stay with parents because of the need in right stage where to go in correct path and even the parents may need in a stage where they feel needy 
50, The young adult mentality may be differ from one to another in such a way that some may want to stay with their parents or some may want to be independent from their parents

50,Writing Task-1As professors giving lecture or any comments on latest events in television will gain some of the knowledge to the public as well as students
50, By this there are many benefits to the professors as well as to universities
50, By giving lectures on television professors acquire a huge reputation in academic fields and in campus
50, If they publish views in academic views only scholars will learn and appreciate views about it
50, By this even university will receive positive publicities of professors who appear in television
50, This will lead to get full of reputations donations and more applications from potential students
50, Mostly television people won’t have contacts with professors either they are experts or else to expose their views
50, And mostly if the professors appear on TV will be having face because of their knowledge but the remaining professors will be able to avoid in meetings conferences because of pity
50, By appearing in TV the professors may waste a lot of time in preparing the content from web as well as to expose their views in front of all
50, This leads to little drawback to them as well as to the universities for wasting a lot time for students and to university
50,Writing Task-2I strongly agree that young people will enjoy a lot more than old people because of multiple aspects situations thoughts that they will have in current life
50, But in rare cases even old people will enjoy life sometimes
50, The young people will have a lot of physical strength remembrance to have fun and be active in all the situations but old people cannot
50, In some cases the younger people will also have lots of mental tensions and frustrations during their work and leads to lose their enjoyment for some time/day
50, While coming to old people they no word to do other than take caring of themselves as well as their families and that they feel like enjoyment for the rest of life
50, For example old people will think about their son/daughter responsibilities that they need in a particular situation they have some fear about the health as well and thoughts would be high by thinking about their grandson or granddaughter all day
50, This will lead to their mental stress and changes in their health
50, Even in some situations cannot handle the work that based on their strength and stamina and at the stage of old age they need to more careful about their health other than concentrating on others
50, Old people should also enjoy in their life because of their handling their children till date
50, Young people will be in a situation where to know that how to enjoy based on the mood that they have for example young people can roam climb dance eat till their stamina get too low
50, There are some situations win which both young and old people will enjoy at same time in which at conventions festivals and get-together
50,Thus based on above reasons I say that young people will enjoy a lot more than old people
50, But at some constraint the old age will arrive after the young age so I say enjoy should be there where no young and old are considered
50, “Life is very short so enjoy more”

51,According to the speaker altruism is an unselfish act with which she completely agrees
51, But she contradicted most of it by valid research
51,Firstly she contradicted the concept of altruism by a research material of meerkats especially about their eating habits
51, Even though one of the meerkats acts as a sentinel of the whole group to safeguard the group still there is a chance for the predators to prey on the group
51, Because the sentinel eat before they stand guard for the whole group and just alarm whenever there is a danger coming
51, This may lead to miscommunication of the alarm sound as it may refer the group to gather or move quickly where the scope of becoming a prey is more
51,Secondly the speaker also took an extreme example to prove the adversity of altruism
51, Here it is if a man donates his kidneys to one of his relatives or to a complete stranger then the question is about will receive any kind of appreciation which is more valuable than the donation?Finally the speaker want to conclude that the even though altruism is a pure concept some of its advantages may also turn into disadvantages in time

51,All large software development projects irrespective of application generate alarge amount of associated documentation
51, For moderately sized systems thedocumentation will probably fill several filing cabinets; for large systems itmay fill several rooms
51, A high proportion of software process costs is incurredin producing this documentation
51, Furthermore documentation errors andomissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures withtheir associated costs and disruption
51, Therefore managers and softwareengineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associatedcosts as to the development of the software itself
51,2
51, a)Process documentation: These documents record the process ofdevelopment and maintenance
51, Plans schedules process qualitydocuments and organizational and project standards are processdocumentation
51,b)Product documentation: This documentation describes the productthat is being developed
51, System documentation describes the productfrom the point of view of the engineers developing and maintaining thesystem; user documentation provides a product description that isoriented towards system users
51,3
51, Effective management requires the process being managed to be visible
51,Because software is intangible and the software process involves apparentlysimilar cognitive tasks rather than obviously different physical tasks the onlyway this visibility can be achieved is through the use of process documentation
51,Process documentation falls into a number of categories:1
51, Plans estimates and schedules: These are documents produced bymanagers which are used to predict and to control the software process
51,2
51, Reports: These are documents which report how resources were usedduring the process of development
51,3
51, Standards: These are documents which set out how the process is to beimplemented
51, These may be developed from organizational national orinternational standards
51,4
51, Working papers: These are often the principal technicalcommunication documents in a project
51, They record the ideas andthoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versionsof product documentation describe implementation strategies and setout problems which have been identified
51, They often implicitly recordthe rationale for design decisions
51,5
51, Memos and electronic mail messages These record the details ofeveryday communications between managers and developmentengineers
51,4
51,The major characteristic of process documentation is that most of it becomesoutdated
51, Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis
51,Progress will normally be reported weekly
51, Memos record thoughts ideas andintentions which change
51,Although of interest to software historians much of this process information isof little real use after it has gone out of date and there is not normally a needto preserve it after the system has been delivered
51, However there are someprocess documents that can be useful as the software evolves in response tonew requirements
51,For example test schedules are of value during software evolution as they actas a basis for re-planning the validation of system changes
51, Working paperswhich explain the reasons behind design decisions (design rationale) are alsopotentially valuable as they discuss design options and choices made
51, Access tothis information helps avoid making changes which conflict with these originaldecisions
51, Ideally of course the design rationale should be extracted from theworking papers and separately maintained
51, Unfortunately this hardly everhappens
51,5
51,Role of working papers: These are often the principal technicalcommunication documents in a project
51, They record the ideas andthoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versionsof product documentation describe implementation strategies and setout problems which have been identified

51,According to the professor in the lecture she made it clear that the idea of professors appearing on television is nowhere benefit to the general public
51, She explained it by considering and comparing university lectures with television lectures
51, Firstly professors who are appearing on television may get good reputation in their respective areas
51, But some of them fetches benefits in it by bombarding themselves in front of their fellow professors
51, And instead they are wasting their time in just appearing on televisions
51, They can’t go in-depth about the academic lectures and make the public confused about the topic
51, Secondly the professor also explains that how some of the research scholars are wasting their time by investing more time in TV lectures
51, They have to prepare for the lecture and have to travel to the studio to present it
51, Also to touch-up themselves to look good in front of the camera which involves a lot of time
51, Instead they can spend the same time for research and helping students in the university
51, They are also not paid handsomely for this where they can’t even afford for their research
51, At last the TV networks are making money by these kind of lectures
51, They only bother about the title of the lecture but not the intellectual content in it
51, And the public are also not interested in watching hours of academic lectures at dinner time
51, So it nowhere benefits the public and the professors who participate in the TV lectures
51, It’s better to educate people by campaigning or expanding schools in every part of the country
53,Task 1: Altruism means the opposite of selfishness; individuals performing it gains nothing for themselves
53,We find altruism in animas like the type of behavior in which an animal’s sacrificing its own interest for that of the animals or groups of animals
53, Altruism abound booth among human and among other mammalsUnselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangest strangers
53, Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another yet provide little reward to the performing the act
53,In fact many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group
53,The meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa is often cited as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the other hunt for food or eat food they have obtained
53, If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as a hawk approaching the group it gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkat’s to run and seek shelter
53,By standing guard the sentinel meerkat gains nothing it goes without food while the other eats and it places itself in grave danger
53,After it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it more at risk to a predator since animals in groups are often able to work tighter to fend off a predator
53,So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat’s group
53,Task 2:Yes now a days the most young adults want independence from parents as soon as possible
53, But I don’t like that; I could prefer to live with my families for my life time
53, Because when in have any most happy situations first persons to share our feeling with our parents and they are the only one how can trust blindly no parent want their child to be in bad situation and they always support to reach our goals and after that also and at last they are the first persons on the world you know
53,For example when I am on 10th standard I don’t use to study but my parents put me in a good collage that he can do the better in that collage so they have trust on me that I can do the beater and have good feature and good life on that my life change to good and it is first step for my life that was made by my parents very strong
53, On that I have reached my goals on support of my parents
53, And I have much experience in my life they support to reach my goals
53, So I like to be with my parents for my life

53, But now a days we find some professors appear as guest on television programs this give great benefits to the them as will as university also
53," By this the university will get the benefits but he will loss of ""Time"" "
53,Professors can spend this time in doing research and giving lecturing in class rooms

53," Task 2Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ?""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"
53,"""A:Some people may think that older people enjoy life more than young people do"
53, However in my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do
53, Young people passion and energy are enough to enjoy life more than older people do
53,Firstly the Young people do not have much responsibly when compare to older people
53, For an example older people have to take care of the their children's and there family this type of responsibly r not on the younger people in the family
53,Coming to work the young people do their work fast because of energetic and speed and good and invitee thoughts to do work
53, then older people
53,Coming to Technology the young people have easy adoptability to new technology then older people
53,To in finally there is a huge difference between young and older people to enjoy their life
53, Of course the older people can also enjoy their life according to their new age
53, They might not feel fully enjoyed life like in their young age
53, On the other hand young people can able to enjoy life by being less responsible more energetic and more following up new things

53,Sources for College Writing Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments
53, First they can draw on personal experiences

55,To: ceo_techm@techmahindra
55,netSubject: Regarding the business IdeaHello Sir             I am Haritha currently working on the project related to the e-commerce super market
55, Basically we are fed up with the idea of the heavy rush super markets where we hate pushing each other struggling to get the proper goods and long lasting queues for bill payment
55, As there is an improvement in our technology we are supposed to come up with idea of some special e-commerce super market where we are assured to get good groceries and fresh fruits and vegetables
55, It is a super market where we can pick the goods and has a hassle free online payment option
55, This is a latest technology which would be adopted by all the markets and remains like a start brand
55,This would be one of the innovative ideas of our generation
55, Expecting a positive reply from you
55, With regardsHaritha
55,SUMMARY OF PASSAGE: AltruismIn audio lecture it is clearly explained about the meerkat species which reside mostly in grassland of Africa
55, These species reside in burrows which have a danger of being attacked by predators
55, In the group of meerkat an individual upholds the responsibility of other members in group taking a stand up looking for predators and guarding without food
55, While the other meerkats hunt their food and eat it
55, If the guarding meerkat sees a predator approaching their group it gives a alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run away and protect themselves
55, By standing the guard and taking up the responsibility of other group members the guard meerkat is not going to obtain anything
55,Well this kind of behavior is termed as altruism in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals
55, It is completely opposite of being selfish and they gain nothing for themselves
55, It is even absorbed in human beings from willing to help someone in need to sharing the organs
55, Such acts meant to benefit others but not the one performing them
55,ESSAY WRITING:Some Young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible
55, Other young adults prefer to live with their family for longer times
55, Which of these situations do you think is better? As being a part of today’s generation representing myself my choice would be living with my loved parents rather than being always from them
55, I don’t think it is fair enough to let them live on their own when they need a strong support in path of their life
55, I would say being with someone who has known you since childhood who can understand a single action of yours is the best thing you would never love to leave
55, Staying away from them and depositing the money in their accounts is not what they need
55, In order to carve up your life they forgot their friends
55, Because of your exams they stopped attending the family functions
55, They don’t even have a social life because of us
55, All they knew is their kids without whom they just can’t live
55, I would say instead of being away from them just stay together where ever you are
55, We might be busy in carving our lives but what’s bad in living with them
55, Once they are with us we would take them as our responsibility with happiness
55, If you have your parents with you all the hectic life turns into something magical where we have our strength by our side always
55, What’s wrong in having a cup of tea together with your parents and sharing your where abouts mom packing a lunch box for you and in night having your dinner together alas that would be happiest days of all
55, They gave everything in order to build up our future but not it’s our turn to present a new life for them with all the happiness in world
55, And the happiness would stay if we are by their side
55, We should owe to provide bundle of happiness for them in order to erase all the sorrows in the world

56,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie
56, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
56,Ans)MOVIE TITLE: DOCTOR STRANGE WHY: Doctor Strange is a 2016 American Superhero film which features the Marvel characters of the same name
56, In the movie Doctor Steven Strange is a cool and confident person who is a neurosurgeon is interested in solving only difficult cases
56, Dr
56, Strange meets with a career ending accident and is badly hurt
56, He finds a place for treatment in Nepal
56, The opening scene of the movie revolves around the streets of Kathmandu where people learn mystic arts and are trained on how to save the world from other dimension and multi-universe enemies
56, In the scene Ancient One who protects the three sanctums in London New York and Hong Kong from Kaecilius who was the former student and has escaped with three zealots
56, This scene was so memorable because it shows how people are trained in Kathmandu and Doctor Strange puts his ego aside and learns the secrets of hidden world mysticism and alternate dimensions
56, Finally Doctor Strange acts as intermediary between the real world and other universe and protects the universe from the Dark Dimension which is ruled by Dormammu
56,MOVIE TITLE: M
56,S DHONI-The Untold Story WHY: M
56,S DHONI-The Untold Story is a 2016 Indian Biographical film which is based on the life of Indian Cricketer and the current Captain of the Indian National Cricket team Mahendra Singh Dhoni
56, The opening scene of the movie begins with its screenplay with the world cup final match in the Wankhede Stadium Mumbai where M
56,S Dhoni is watching the match live on screen
56, He understands that the situation is critical and decides to take the stand and telling the authorities that he would go to bat if a wicket falls down
56, He then takes his bat and walks down the stairs leading towards the cricket pitch
56, He wins the final match and is selected as the captain of the Indian Cricket team
56, This scene is memorable because it shows that we should be strong enough to take decisions at any time and should face the situation but run away from that
56, It throws a message that we should never give up
56, The audience watching the cricket match think that India will not win the match but Dhoni keeps his strength and spirit and proves that self confidence is necessary to attain success
56, QUESTION 2:1
56,    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?Ans) Everyone has that one dream place which they would like to visit atleast once in their life
56, Even I have my own dreamland which I would like to visit with my family
56,I’d like to visit the Vaadhoo beach in Maldives if I got a chance to go on vacation anywhere in the world
56, I’ve chosen this place because I’ve heard a lot from visitors who travel to this place telling that Natural phenomenon turns the Maldives sea water brighter than milky way
56, There is a glow in the water which makes the beach look like as if the stars were floating
56, Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
56, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
56, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
56, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
56, Ans) Physical fitness is also important when compared with studies
56, If students don’t get time to play sports they might feel stressed and under pressure
56, They cannot concentrate on studies and this may result in a decrease in their academic progress
56, In Addition to that children who are physically fit are less prone to medical conditions
56, I think that school day should not be longer and proper schedule should be followed so that students can manage their time properly and spend their time both for studies and sports activities

56,While I was trolling few career websites this week I noticed that your company has a tout out for an intern this summer
56, The position sounds rad
56, Can you send me an email and tell me about the application process?
56,In the lecture it is said that professors have a lot of disadvantages when they appear on the Television
56, It is not good for the professor itself when he appears on television
56, Whereas in the reading passage it is mentioned that professors are benefitted when they appear on the television
56, But in doing so they are losing their own self respect and image in the society
56, Firstly When a professor appears on the television he might acquire reputation as stated in the passage but he is losing his position
56, He might not be allowed to attend any important meetings or conferences as the other attendees may think that he is a TV celebrity and likes to entertain than to educate people
56,Secondly In the lecture we hear that a professor wastes his valuable time when he attends any show or event
56, The time he takes to prepare for the event the time he takes to travel to the venue the time taken to perform is all waste
56, Rather he can do a research and educate people instead of entertaining them
56, But in the passage it is mentioned that when he is on television he gains a lot of publicity and popularity among the people which is wrong
56, This assumption is false as the people might think in a negative way and stop listening to him further
56, In doing so he might also lose his chances of getting any research work
56,It is also a disadvantage for the university as well
56, In the Passage it is mentioned that university has a lot of advantage when a professor who belongs to that appears on television
56, University gets a lot of publicity there is an increase in reputation people think that the university is good and there are more number of donations and admissions but it is all proved wrong in the lecture where we come to know how dangerous and critical it is when a college/university professor appears on television
56, Yes it does have a negative impact
56, When people see them on television they might think that it is a bad university as the professor is entertaining on the television rather than being on campus and training students
56, People also think that the professor doesn’t have any knowledge so he is entertaining
56,Finally we can conclude by saying that professors need to be on campus but not on televisions which can ruin their image and respect in the society
56,Youngsters have the spirit and enthusiasm of doing whatever they like
56, When people are at a younger stage they are strong and have a positive attitude towards work i
56,e “I can”
56, They never say no to anything
56, Yes I agree with the statement that young people enjoy more when compare to old people
56,According to me when people are young they have freedom to go to any place except a few restrictions
56, Firstly Young people posses a lot of energy when compared to the older ones
56, Old people might have disabilities and may not be able to walk properly
56, But young people though they have any problem they can do a lot of activities at a time
56, When people are young they can move freely in any type of environment and have any roadside food but when they turn old they need to maintain a balanced diet and live in a healthy pollution free environment
56, They cannot just walk away onto the streets like the young people
56, Secondly young people don’t have any responsibilities like the old people do
56, They have the freedom to enjoy their life in the way they want to
56, Whereas old people have a lot of responsibilities
56, They have to take care of their children take care of the family members responsibility to control the people around them manage financial issues etc
56, They also have to work and earn to live
56, But young people don’t need to earn or work
56, These all problems are bared by their parents
56, Old people also have the responsibility of joining their children in schools colleges and get them married when they become grown ups
56,Young people have more knowledge about what is happening in the world as they are always connected online through internet
56, They have a lot of technical exposure in contrast to the old people
56, A 10 year old boy can operate a smart phone without facing any issues but a 30 year old person might feel difficult to operate it
56, In today’s world young people think in a creative way
56, The thinking capability of a young person is more when compared to a old person
56, For example if two persons (one old and one young) are given a task to complete the younger persons perspective will be more creative and detailed than the old person
56,Young people are open minded and are free to choose from what they have
56, Whereas old people think a lot to take any decision
56, For example if a youngster wants to watch a movie he just checks for the available list of movies and books his/her ticket for one
56, But old person needs to think about his family about the story about his children’s like and dislike and then make a choice out of it
56, Young people can ride bikes at a faster speed they can play jump travel long distances and do a lot of things with ease
56, But old people cannot
56, They are not physically fit
56,Finally younger people enjoy life more than old people
56, Younger people have a lot of friends and can make connections easily using social networking sites whereas old people only have to sit idle at home as they don’t have proper knowledge on how to use technology
56, Young people have no boundary line and enjoy their life to the fullest
56, Old people are bounded by restrictions and responsibilities
56, Young people are instilled with the spirit of doing anything
56, Old people lack that spirit at times but they can also overcome that by thinking in a positive way and having a positive mindset towards life

56,Writing Task 1The given passage tells us about Altruism which is a type of behaviour in which one kind of species sacrifice their own interest for others
56,It can be found in both animals and as well as in humans

56, SecondlyI'd like to share the scenario of the situation in which Children stay along with their parents for longer time
56,In such a situationboth parents and children care for eachother
56,Younger adults take a lot of care of their parents
56,They take them out for lunch/dinner whenever they are free
56,Celebrate with them on occassions

56,They pray god to keep their parents safe
56,They sacrifice their parties/hangouts with friends in order to take their parents to someplace
56,They donot let their parents to go to long distances all alone
56,Such people should be as a role model for others who dont take proper care of their parents
56, FinallyI'd conclude by saying that its a duty of each and every indivisual to take care of their parents
56,They should never step backwards
56,They should more considerate towards their parents
56,They should be against the world and stand always infront of their parents to protect them
56,Younger adults should be like a shield to their parents
56,At timesyou should also be harsh with your wife/children if they are aginst your parents
56,Everyone needs to realize the sacrifices their parents have made in order to help you to achieve our dreams
56,I hereby support this situation and think that younger adults should live with their families for longer time

57, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
57,MOVIE TITLE: TAKEN 1WHY:In the film “Taken 1” which is released in 2008 is directed by “Pierre Morel” the introduction scene was the 5th birthday of the Maggie Grace (Kim) who is the daughter of the Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) who is an retired CIA(Central Intelligent Agent)
57, The opening scene is memorable because it shows his love and care towards Kim
57, In the course of the movie Kim gets kidnapped while she was on a trip to Paris and before the kidnap Bryan Mills calls Kim and he records Kim’s voice
57, With the help of the recorded voice Bryan Mills uses his skills which he acquired while working as a CIA and saves his estranged daughter
57,MOVIE TITLE: Chak De IndiaWHY:The film “Chak De India” was directed by “Shimit Amin” and released on 2007
57, The opening scene was the final match of “World Men’s Hockey Championship” between “Arch Rivals” India and Pakistan
57, In which India loses to Pakistan with 0-1 margin
57, After the end of the match Kabir Khan(Shah Rukh Khan) shakes the hands with the Pakistan’s captain as the sports men ship but one of the media channel misunderstands it and publishes it(negatively against Kabir Khan) as if he fixed the match
57, After that hockey India Federation bans him playing for the country and files a court case against him
57, Later he coaches the Indian Hockey Women’s team which leads India to win the “Women’s Hockey World Cup”
57,QUESTION 2:Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I could go on vacation anywhere in the world then I will go to Amarnath cave which is a Hindu shrine located in Jammu and Kashmir
57, It is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga’s (The Radiant Sign of the Almighty Siva) in India
57, Since the cave is mostly surrounded by snowy mountains Lingam (one of the forms Lord Siva) or Ice Stalagmite formed inside the cave
57, People believes it is the cave where Siva explained the secret of life and eternity to his consort Parvathi
57, The main reason why I want to go to Amarnath because it has no transportation facility
57, Pilgrims travel on foot either from Srinagar or from Pahalgam with the help of the resident there which take approximately 5 days to reach the cave
57, It will be challenging to climb the mountainous terrain to see the Ice form of Lord Siva moreover the whole route will be monitored by the military persons due to border security issues with neighbouring countries
57, The NGO’s will supply the food for the pilgrims and there will be pandals to take the rest during the bad weather conditions the temperature over there some times will dip into minus degree centigrade due to which many pilgrims will with draw from travelling and some people will die

57, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
57,Every school board should give the equal importance to the study and sports because along with the studies the sports also plays a very crucial role in one’s student life
57, According to me everyone will not be successful due to studies itself along with the studies sports also need some time in every student life sports should become the part of the students life because sports helps the students to take the decisions quickly wisely and that too correctly
57, They helps the students to relax from regular burden/studies and they can be physically fit
57, Leadership qualities decision making skills team work skills can be improved due to the sports
57, Moreover many sports persons in the world are school or college dropouts (Sachin Tiger woods Messi etc) but they are well reputed and respected in the society
57, So consideration all the above facts school board should not implement longer school days but instead make sport practices as a part of daily curriculum

58,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie
58, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
58,The Dark Knight:The movie starts off with a group of robbers driving towards a bank
58, They show their anger by saying that Joker The guy who planned the heist was not participating
58, Once the robbery commences the goons start killing other robbers from their group
58, Spotting this unusual tactic as an opportunity the bank manager takes out a shotgun and starts firing at the robbers
58, A single robber remains but the manager gets shot
58, The manager states that the last robber will suffer the same fate as the others and the Joker will kill him too
58, The robber then takes off his mask revealing that he is the Joker himself
58, The Joker then places a grenade in the manager’s mouth whose trigger is tied to the back of a bus
58, He then rides of in the bus with all the money
58,The reason why it is so memorable is because of the unusual plan laid by the Joker to steal money from a bank
58, When the Joker reveals himself and rides of in a bus It perfectly shows the characters mentally unstable state of mind
58,The Dark Knight Rises:The movie begins with a CIA agent capturing three men and transporting them in a plane
58, He starts asking them about their leader Bane
58, He tries to make them talk by threatening them but none of them do
58, When he starts to threaten the second person the third person talks
58, When the mask is removed it turns out to be Bane
58, A second plane arrives from which Bane’s accomplices jump down and shoot all the people in the agents plane
58, Bane then escapes with his accomplices and a nuclear physicist whom he meant to capture by getting caught
58,I like the opening of this movie because of the graphics shown where one plane is tied to another and dragged
58, The immense confidence and strength of Bane showing his nature and leadership was clearly shown and Bane himself had an intimidating look which was then carried in throughout the whole movie
58,
58,Excercise-1:We are working hard to remove poverty
58,Students should contact us for help with their semester plans
58,The tragedy could have been avoided if the workers were warned regarding hazards of the workplace
58,The population of the island is 12046with possibility of 5% growth by 2012
58,A commerce graduate can apply their knowledge to the real world
58,Excercise-2:From 4th August Students will be selected according to legal requirements and diversity startergies
58,The pasport office replaces old passports lostdamaged or destroyed until the recent floods for free
58, Eligible applicants contact the Passport Information Service(PIS) on 998 9988 for more information
58,Our office can investigate the matter if any Oragnization or agency breaches the privacy principles or an individual makes a privacy complaint if they think their information was mishandled
58,Aid Agency helps people's lives devastated by natural disasters and conflict by providing emergency relief and continued support to affected communities to rebuild and rehabilitate
58,Most people feel that Government employees need to communicate more effectively
58,
58,The lecture is based on the study of altruistic behaviour
58, Altruism is the sacrifice of one's own intrest for the sake of others It is the opposite of selfishness where people gain nothing but non-material rewards like appreciation and self worth
58, The study made clear that altruistic acts are performed by both humans and animals
58, Some humans show altruistic behaviour by sharing food and donating some even donate organs to family members or strangers
58,Animals have a similar way of showing this behaviour by sharing food and sometimes even sacrifice their life to benefit other members or a group of animals
58, One example of such behaviour is found in meerkats which belong to the grasslands of africa
58, In groups of meerkats an individual meerkat acts as a sentinel and keeps a look out for predators like hawks while the other meerkats go foraging
58,when the sentinel spots a predator it sounds an alarming cry that alerts the other meerkats to hide themselves
58,Previously it was thought that the sentinel is on a full stomach and is always the one which has the best chance of survival as it is closest to the burrow while the others are scattered through the land but eventually this turned out to be wrong as the sentinel is the last one to hide
58,I think that the preference of young adults to live with their families or not varies from one individual to another based on how they are brought up
58,"If a person feels that he is being constrained by the ""rules"" laid down in their familythey may think that someplace where there are no such rules would be better"
58, Some people always dream of living alone where they can make their own rules and live however they want
58, There are others who can support themselves without the help of their parentsThis doesnt mean these people hate their parents it is just their belief that they can live life as an able individual without their parents help
58, Contradictary to this some people prefer to stay close to their familiesNow these people may want to stay because of various reasons such as unemployment or wanting to return the love of their parents who raised them from kids to adults by supporting them financially and easing some burden on their shoulders
58,People who come from a backward class family have many less options when it comes to living individually but staying with ones parents does not reduce their work and when the parents get older and older the same work tends to become tougher and tougher
58,I would like to conclude this passage saying that young adults should move out of their family home to experience life as an individual but always take care of ones family because it is the only thing that stays with a person from when one was born untill their death

59,Example Set 1: Introductions in EssaysExamples of Good Introduction Paragraphs:Set 1:“On March 4 1849 John Smith was born to Anna Bradcock Smith and James Smith
59, Although certainly not of humble origins John was acquainted with several prominent and influential men of politics with whom he discussed matters of mathematics history science logic law and theology
59, Smith was brilliant in each of these fields but he became known particularly for his contributions in the fields of philosophy mathematics and logistics
59, This paper will not only shed light on some of Smith's theories and words regarding these three areas but will also tell of the events in his life that made him the man that he was
59,”This is the introduction to a chronologically-ordered essay about Smith's life and discoveries
59, As such the choice to begin with his date of birth is a good one
59, The paragraph summarizes the fields touched by Smith and also mentions the key areas he studied
59, The paper sets up an expectation for the reader of both a detailed explanation of Smith's discoveries and anecdotes describing his personality
59, The sentence structure is grammatically sound and flows well
59, Set 2:“Stereotypes abound in today's society
59, People seem to have an innate compulsion to categorise others into various groups and then to apply rigid and limited descriptions to these groups
59, There are therefore amongst others stereotypical nationalities and races; stereotypical sexes and sexual orientations and stereotypical classes
59, And one place where these stereotypes often thrive is in the mass media particularly in the tabloid press and popular television such as in situation comedy
59, Some for example Hick (1996) claim that this is a harmless phenomenon whereas commentators such as Ealham (1998) point to the possible dangers of obsessive stereotyping in the media
59, This essay will examine what sociological evidence there is for the process of stereotyping in the mass media and will then go on to analyse the reasons for its occurrence
59, The final part of the essay will ask how far society's attitudes are in fact shaped by this portrayal of the various kinds of stereotypes
59,”This is a very good introduction
59, It's about the right length; gives a little relevant background and context indicating that the writer has thought about what a stereotype is in its broadest interpretation; makes some initial references to sources; and finally focuses precisely on the question showing the reader that it has been fully understood and that it will be answered
59, Note that the wording of the final part of the introduction is very close to that of the question
59, If the essay follows in the same vein it should get an excellent mark
59,Please answer these questions in a separate word document and upload the document on the submission link provided outside this lesson

59, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices

59,The lecture describes about the Altruism
59, It is a common behaviour found in humans as well as in animals
59,it is an act of sacrificing our interest for others
59,the people here are selfless and perform its but not for there gain The altruism is an act of sharing food to a beggar or stranger to risking their own lives for others
59,some of best example is you get is of meerkats they live in Africa 
59,they actually act standing guard while others are looking for food or eat food they obtained 
59,they guard them from predator like hawk 
59,while this act they give alaram cry alerting the ither meerkats to run and seek shelter 
59,but during this act it gains nothing i
59,e
59, it goes without food while others eat and it places itself in danger
59,after alaram it has to flee alone which is a risk but other can form a group to fend of predator The lecture conclude that l people who performs altruism will not have any special status or benefit from the society despite in some condition even they have the to risk their life’s for this actSome young want independence from their parents as soon as possible other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time This passage talks about young adults living with their families is better situation to live with the parents or leave them aloneActually its depends upon various factors like their brought up culture by parents or the situation they live in and so on etcSo here i support the condition to live with the family rather living alone
59,The God has made a chain that it unbreakable say like when the child is born it will be dependent on the parents until and unless they be come to certain age where they are able to live life on their own but until then some families or parents depend on their children because of their age or certain work cannot be done by them so at that time they have to be dependent on their children it is an vice versa 
59,so the above we can say that ultimately it is the nature that choose the people on their role
59,living as a family has many benefitsWhere as leaving alone are away from those advantages like sharing each and every part of the life 
59,while in bad times they will help each other and at goodtime they enjoy most but for they people who live alone it will to be hard to find relatives or friend who will be always with you but in families they are always with you But when you should live with family but don’t depend on them always instead of living depending on families always at that situation its better to live alone in this caseBut if you are not dependent then living with our own family is the best option an most of them also should prefer this as it also help the country to be poverty free etcFrom the above we can conclude the best option for young adults is prefer to live with their families for a longer time

59, Hasmitha meet ArunArun I want to introduce you to Hasmitha
59, She’s been a partner at Idea Labs Bombay for the last 5 years and I know you’re looking for a strong content developer for your company
59, She’s probably too modest to mention it but she was on Times Now last week 
59,she works for top 5 Websites of various Background which in returns gets more than 20X of the original web traffic to our websites 
59, She has been one of my good friends 
59, Hasmitha Arun is a Team Manager at AccerInc and is looking for a content developer for his company
59, As I mentioned to you he’s the most promising person to work with
59, He is the very optimistic and creative
59, You both grew up in Hyderabad and are now based in Bombay
59, And also worked on almost same kind of projects in past
59,Arun – will you follow up with Hasmitha over email to set up a phone call? Thanks & RegardsUbaid
59,When I was trolling some career websites this week I noticed that your company has a trot out for an intern this summer
59, The position sounds rad 
59, Can you shoot me back and email and tell me what’s up with the application process?When I was trawling some career websites this week I noticed that your company has a scamper out for an intern this summer
59, The position sounds incredible
59, Can you shoot me back and email and tell me what’s up with the application process?
59,The professor discusses the topic of professors' appearance on TV
59, She is strongly against this kind of behaviour and at the same time she opposes the points given in the reading
59, She supports her opinion with three examples
59, First the professor claims that when a praised professor shows up in a TV programme his situation as a scholar may get worse because such person would appear as a celebrity wanting to be in a spotlight
59, This may cause fewer and fewer invitations to the academic conferences and even financial support for his research may be declined
59, This goes against the passage which stated that since so many people watch television by visiting the TV programmes an academic person may obtain a respect among wider auditorium
59, Second the professor says that going to TV programmes is just a waste of time
59, Teachers should spend their time on campus since they are hired by the university
59, If the instructor spends his time in TV studio it is obvious that he is not available for students who may need him
59, This way students' interests suffer
59, This again refutes the article which said that actually university benefits from professor appearance in TV because more people will be familiar with the famous name and therefore more students will apply for this particular university
59, Third the lecturer thinks that TV channel does not benefit from inviting an acclaimed scholar
59, Television is nothing but entertainment and viewers are not interested in deep insight to the topic
59, That is way professors usually gives just a brief speech on some topics
59, This is a counterargument to the passage which showed that people benefit form professor's appearance since most of the viewers have no contact with a university’s person they can get opinions from professionals
59,  These are the main negative aspects of professor’s appearance on TV given by the professor in her lecture
59, Neither professor nor university or television benefits from it
59,Young people enjoy life than old people doIn my opinion to enjoy life age should not be a barrier young or old does not matter
59, Everyone has their own way of enjoying life
59, Young people have lot of energy and money to spend but they are usually short of time with their busy schedule of office work family and building their career
59,On the other hand older people although they are little short of energy but they have lot of time and life experiences to understand the value of even the most simplest things in life
59, Most of the older people are retired from work and they prefer to spend their time on things which they enjoy
59, They utilize their time by spending on the things they like hobbies they were longing for since young age spending time with their friends family and their grand-children
59, For instance my grand-father was very busy in his young age as he has too look after his business had to attend lot of business meetings
59, He had very little time to spend to go out on vacations or to spend with family
59, But after retirement he used to to spend most of his time with his friends playing golf exploring new places and spend time with family
59,While on the other hand younger people are busy with their work life which is getting very stressful in this competitive world
59, So young individuals do not get much time to spend on stress free vacations or with family
59,Senior citizens seems to enjoy simpler things so much easier than young people do
59, Older people enjoy just sitting with their friends and having a cup of coffee
59, They just seem to appreciate being alive and being able to see the people they are
59, On the other hand young people do not truly appreciate what they have till they experience some hardships in their lives
59, In conclusion older people enjoy life with more spirit and happiness as compared to younger people

6,CREATIVE WRITING ASSIGNMENTCharacter – A college studentSetting – An expensive restaurantTime – Sometime in DecemberSituation – Someone’s pride has been injured A frigid North- westerly wind blew over the city which was nestled in the mountains
6, Decembers in that area were usually cool but this year it was colder
6, Jayesh chalked it up to climate change as he hurried down the steps of his college library
6, He was late for a meeting with his friends
6, Well it wasn’t really a meeting – his friend Vamsi was recruited by Amazon and he was throwing a party to celebrate the occasion
6, If only I made it through he thought wistfully as he recollected his Amazon interview
6, Anyway the past was past and he decided not to dwell on it
6, He walked towards his destination expertly navigating through traffic with ease
6, Four years of living in the city made it almost involuntary
6, This was not always the case
6, He remembered being overwhelmed by the city and its hectic pace when he first enrolled in his college
6, Though he visited the city before it was the first time he had to stay there for an extended period of time
6, His thoughts then turned to his village and his parents
6, He almost missed the restaurant in his reverie
6, He laughed at that as the restaurant was difficult to miss in the busiest of days
6, There is only one word to describe it he thought – ostentatious
6, He felt relieved that he failed his Amazon interview – there was no way he could afford to throw a party here! As he walked towards the entrance of the restaurant he began searching for his friends
6, When he didn’t see them he assumed they were already inside
6, He dialled Vamsi and realised that he was out of mobile balance
6, He continued walking towards the door when he was confronted by a scary looking valet

6, My friends are waiting for me” Jayesh replied in confusion
6,The valet looked him over dubiously
6, Blood rushed to Jayesh’s face
6, It was true that he was looking shabby when compared to the other clientele but it was his best set of clothes! “Yeah right!” the valet said mockingly “I’ve never heard that before!” By this time Jayesh was fuming inside
6, He tried to reason with the valet but to no avail
6, In frustration he tried to push past the valet
6, The valet who was bigger than Jayesh easily overwhelmed him and threw him to the curb
6, People started to gather around observing the ruckus
6, Jayesh felt utterly humiliated and alone
6, Slowly his pain turned to rage
6, He gradually found his feet and looked at the valet who was sneering at him
6, He vowed to himself that one day he would avenge this humiliation
6, He turned around and started walking
6, He ignored the cold wind the ringing of his phone and the stares of the passers-by and kept on walking till he reached his room
6, “And that was the incident that made me what I am today” he told his grand-children gathered around him in the same restaurant where he was humiliated all those years ago
6, Only now he owned it

6, It is to give you feedback on your performance and to point out areas that you need to work on
6, Let me begin by saying that you have prodigious technical skills
6, There is no doubt in that
6, However the success of a project doesn’t depend on the technical skills of an individual member

6, As I mentioned previously the client feels that you are doing a satisfactory job
6, However I feel that for a person with your capabilities that is not good enough
6, I believe the reason behind that assessment to be your presentation skills
6, So please work on them
6, Finally from what I observe you are not confrontational
6, You’d rather spend your time working than debating
6, Though it is commendable I’ve noticed that you don’t assert yourself even when it is necessary
6, Assertive communication is essential for inter-personal skills which are necessary to function in a team

6,Summary:The following points were made in the lecture that contrast the points made in the passage: A new scientific study revealed some interesting facts about a previously documented behaviour of Meerkats
6, According to the study a Meerkat that stands sentinel while other Meerkats search for food does so after it eats
6, This is opposite to the view point expressed in the reading passage which can imply that the sentinel is going without food
6,The next point the lecturer says is that since the sentinel is the first to see the predator it has a better chance of survival when compared to the other meerkats in the group foraging for food
6, This opposes the point made in the passage which tries to imply that the sentinel is at maximum risk
6,Another interesting point is made with regards to the behaviour of sentinel
6, The lecturer cites some studies which show that the act of the sentinel raising the alarm actually diverts the predator's attention from the sentinel
6, It instead focuses the predator's attention towards the other animals in the group
6, The lecture ends by offering some counter-points to the altruistic behaviour of humans
6, The lecturer discusses the extreme case of a person donating his kidney
6, She says that such an act is not completely selfless and has some motives
6, She lists approval and appreciation by other humans and a feeling of self-worth in the donor as some motivations
6,Essay: In my opinion young adults should be independent from their parents but with some exceptions
6, The age between teenage and adulthood is young adulthood
6, It might not be an exaggeration to say that it is perhaps the most critical time in a human's life
6, It is the age which can define someone for the rest of their lives
6, What we do during our young adulthood can have a far-reaching impact in our life
6, If we compare the teenage years of one's life to a cinema the young adulthood can be compared to the climax
6, It is the period where everything we learnt during our childhood and teenage years comes to fruition
6, It is a period of great flux
6, It is important that the young adults be given the independence to take their own decisions
6, By taking their own decisions they become responsible for their own future
6, For some parents letting go of their children can be hard but they must realize that by denying their children their independence they are only holding them back
6,The young adults can learn a lot if given the independence which will give them an edge over their peers in their careers
6, Parents must realize that teenage years are like riding a bicycle with training wheels on
6, When they enter the young adulthood the training wheels must be removed otherwise they can become a permanent crutch which their children will have to depend on
6, The other side of the argument is that since it is such a critical age the children should not be left with proper supervision
6, It is certainly valid
6, The young adults have to face a lot of stress not only related to their lives but also related to their careers
6, When faced with so much stress and so many expectations they may develop bad habits and go down the wrong path
6, Also if their peers are a bad influence then they can damage their future in bad company if constant adult supervision is not present
6, However valid the previous arguments may be they can't counter the advantages of having independence
6, So I believe that young adults wanting their independence should be allowed to have it
6, However moderation is required
6, There must be some means for their parents or well-wishers to monitor at least certain aspects of their life
6, They must be made accountable for their lives
6, Freedom without accountability will lead to disaster

61,ARUN KUMAR- IH201685061Format:MOVIE TITLE: Siva (1989 telugu film)WHY? The movie starts off with a serious scene showing a Rowdy and his gang beating a couple of students and the background music given by Ilayaraja was mindblowing
61, The scene ends with a car starting and from the smoke the titles appear with a back ground music
61, The speciality of the movie title is if you look at the movie posters before the release they all have a standard template with Yellow color font
61, Siva is the first movie to change that with a Red Font and the title has been designed by Teja (Chitram movie Director)
61, The story behind this title is when Teja designed this title and sent it for printing the printing employees rejected it and asked to send it back in standard Yellow font
61, Knowing this RGV asked Teja “What do you want to do?
61,” Teja was so confident and said on the lines which meant “Sir do you want to make a routine movie as others or do you want to do something different?” The printing employees had nothing to do but create a new template specially for Siva title
61,MOVIE TITLE: Brindavanam (2010 telugu film)WHY? A typical cinema hero introduction scene always shows a high voltage action episode and the energy levels involved in it
61, The fans go crazy over their favorite hero’s entrance scene and brindavanam movie has the best introduction scene in the year 2010
61, The movie starts with a fight scene where hero saves his friends life from the goons and helps them
61, The fight scene composition was awesome and screenplay was superb
61, Watch the brilliance of director in the screenplay the scene starts off by focusing bats and other weapons and then shows hero
61, The mass image of hero in that scene elevates his heroism and the punch dialogues in that scene were amazing
61, Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I could go on vacation anywhere in the world then I would visit Chardham yatra
61, Chardham are the names of four pilgrimage sites in India that are widely valued by Hindus
61, It comprises Badrinath Dwarka Puri and Rameswaram
61, It is considered highly sacred by Hindus to visit Char Dham during one's lifetime
61, It is one of the finest yatra in all over world
61, The direct special buses for Chardham also available nowadays and route is good roads are well maintained by the government now and roads well connected to the major parts of the other holy regions such as temples ponds Lakes River falls etc
61, Time is mostly the morning cause it beliefs that the Pilgrimage journey should be started in the beginning of the day
61, Approximately 10 days required to complete the holy journey
61, The Best time during yatra will be when visiting to haridwar Barkot Uttarkashi Almora etc are the major places to visit
61, The Chardham yatra is on at the moment with thousands of people visiting the four dhams everyday
61, So you can too

61,Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
61, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
61, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
61, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
61,Implementing a longer school days are not beneficial
61, Teachers and students want a better school day not a longer one and quantity does not produce quality
61, Therefore extending the school day will not produce a huge increase in learning
61, We already know that most of the children in schools today resent a longer school day
61, Concerns for the children are important
61, Students who experience frequent changes in their school day length's experience distress which can lead to emotional problems and behavioral problems issues
61, These changes most affect students with prior behavioral problems and learning disabilities
61,The more time kids spend in school the less time they'll have outside of school
61, This is time they currently spend on extracurricular activities of their choice
61, Students will spend time in a basic physical education class instead of dance karate or listening to music
61, Children already spend a large portion of their day being told what to do how to do it and what rules to follow and have little free time as it is
61, The ability to make their own decisions on how to spend their time is a learning experience too
61,If the teaching methods used currently aren't working spending more time using those same methods isn't going to change anything
61, Quality time is better than the quantity of time spent
61, Before deciding to extend the school day consider changes that can be included to solve the specific issues the school is facing

64,Among all my friends Ram is my best friend
64, We met each other four years ago in my cousin's birthday party
64, First time when I saw him I didn't like him much but after meeting him for couple of times I began to like him as he was kind and have good helping nature
64, Though he is not a good player he likes to play games
64, He loves to visit new places
64, Whenever he is angry he doesn't fight or show his anger on others
64, He just keeps calm and do his work silently
64, Apart from all these there is a lot to say about him
64, But to say simply he is a good loving person
64, Father mother brother sister and relatives are given by god but friend is the only one whom we choose
64, Thus I feel lucky to a have such a good person Ram as my best friend
64,   People around globe are busy with their works whereas I’m busy in my college as a student
64, My day in the college begins at 08:30 am
64, Every morning when I come to class I decide to study seriously
64, But sometimes as the time passes I continue to waste it by doing unnecessary work
64, To be clear in the morning after coming to lab I will practice GAMA which is a part of our academic topics
64, After completing it I work on IT
64, At 10’o clock I go for a break for around 30 minutes
64, After returning it would take some time for me to start practicing those IT programs
64, I will continue till our lunch time
64, At 12:30 pm I happily shut down my system and move for lunch
64, After having lunch if there is time I will chit chat with my friends until lunch time is finished
64,After coming from lunch my IT batting begins where I keep on practicing and developing new programs to perform well in our exams
64, In the afternoon from 3’o clock to 4’clock I will attend soft skill session
64, After completing the soft skill session I’ll go for a break and have some snacks
64, After returning from break again I continue with my IT work up to 6’0 clock in the evening
64, In between whenever I feel stressed I take a nap or listen to songs or watch movies in online
64, After 6 pm if there is any soft skill or IT task to do I will complete that go to play for some time or leave to my room
64, After that I will have my dinner and go to sleep else if interested I will study for some time or chit chat with my friends

65,MOVIE TITLE: SultanWHY:Sultan (2016) is the film directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and casted by Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma
65, It has one of the greatest opening that I have ever saw
65, It starts like this Big Renowned business man who owns a reality show gets loss
65, Then his (Business Tycoon) father says about the hero (Salman Khan) who is the former world champion but lost interest in the play due to some personal problems
65, He says about the traits of the person which was picturised nicely which made curious about the rest of the film
65,MOVIE TITLE: Bhaag Milkha BhaagWHY:Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013) is the film directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and casted by Farhan Akhtar and sonam kappor in supporting role
65, Up to me it has one of the best opening that have ever saw
65, It starts in this way a group of atheist entered in to the stadium who are ready to race in Rome Olympics 1960 the commentators were speaking about the greatness of Milkha Singh
65, In the mean while race got started and Milkha Singh was much ahead of all the athletes on the track but in a sudden he turned back due to some unknown past experiences drawn my curiosity to towards the movie
65, Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?They are so many world-famous destinations where people want to visit on their vacation like Paris Bangkok United States and many
65, But I would like to go to all Jyotirlingas present at several places in India
65,They are 12 Jyotirlingas present in India they are Somnath(Gujarat) Mallikarjuna Swami(Srisailam) Mahakaleshwar (Madhya Pradesh) Omkareshwar (Madya Pradesh) Kedharnath(Uttarakhand) Bhimashankar(Maharashtra) Kashi Vishwanath (Uttar Pradesh) Trimbakeshwar(Maharashtra) Nageshwara(Gujarat) Vaidyanath(Jharkhand) Rameshwar(Tamilnadu) Grishneshwar(Maharashtra)
65,They Draw my curiosity because there was a saying that the god itself originated at that place by taking different manifestos
65,They are so many temples all over the world but these temples got their unique importance because of the faith by the people and the other side is they are located in the locations which draw the attentions of the pilgrims and make them feel peaceful
65,So I will like to go to all the jyotirlingas in my life time in order to get some refreshment and to get some inner peace
65, I will also recommend people to do so even if they don’t believe they can enjoy the environment over there
65, Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
65, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
65, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
65, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
65,School is a place where students study learn and enjoy what they do
65, There will be so many memories of the schooling days which built us with so many good qualities
65, In this I would like to discuss about the pros and cons of implementing a longer school day
65,I don’t want to support these longer school days because this is the age where they play and learn in an enjoyable way
65, If there is any imbalance in their studies and playing students can’t digest it which makes them anti towards studies alsoEven sports play a major role in student’s life because according to studies they increase more concentration in the students which in turn help the studies to study with higher concentration by which they can study amore in less time
65,Researches proved that students cannot concentrate on their studies for long hours
65, It is also proved that better results can be achieved by engaging them in extracurricular activities
65,So I would Strongly Recommend not to increase the timing of school

65,Importance of Television Lectures by ProfessorsThe article says about the importance of television to the professors university as well as to the general public and show cases three reasons to support
65, Anyhow the author says that the common people are the group how get more advantage from such types of shows
65,At First the readings say that professors are most beneficious among the three since they acquire reputation in their academic fields by appearing on television
65, But the author states that professors who appear on television are entertainers rather than scholars
65,Second the article says that universities benefit much from such sort of appearances
65, However the professors think the that is not that much beneficial to their university
65, Professors think that those television shows are time wasting for them because they need to keep their work aside and prepare their content for the show
65, They think that that time can be spent on educating students or by doing research
65,Third one is the reading says that the public gains more from professors’ TV appearance
65, But they are so many people against it and they say that television networks never want academic lectures
65, They keep on titles but there will not be any intellectual substances
65,Young people enjoy life more than older people In the first place the younger people will have so many options to enjoy their life when compared to older people
65, Because the world of the older people is very less
65, For Example Younger people play games online surf next see movies watch YouTube and many more
65, But these all things are not done by older people
65, Younger people can go where ever they want and do whatever they want
65, Younger people have more different choices to make
65, The young generation can make their life’s much more convenient with the help of Technology
65,Secondly the young have very much limitations to enjoy their life because they are young they can perform various activities such as paragliding rock climbing without any hesitation because they are fit enough to do such sort of things
65, Whereas the people in old age can find these things much interesting because they don’t have that much of energy and wish to do all those things and even if they are almost fit they never try to take riskIn the third place the younger people are much energetic less sophisticated than the older people
65, Because the younger people are much more flexible which makes them fit through their life
65, Whereas older people draws their conclusion from their waste experience by which they end up with routine ideas
65, Whereas younger people always try everything to be creative and new in order to enjoy their life up to maximum extent
65, The younger generations never take care of the future happenings and spend their life very happily
65, Whereas the older people thinks about their future and they never enjoy even if they have enough wealth to do that
65, Finally what I want to conclude is definitely the young enjoy their life much more than the older people

65,Rembrandt is one of the famous painters from Dutch in 17th century
65, They are so many paintings of his remembrance
65, But there was one painting of a lady which didn't matched his style of painting
65, There are three major reasons to say that it is not the painting drawn by him
65, They areThe lady in that picture wore a white linen cap which even servants can afford
65, But her dress color was made of luxurious fur and Rembrandt will never make a mistake at the selection of dresses
65, After some experiments scientist came to know that the color was again repainted after 100 years of when it was painted
65,The second reason is because of original white linen can her face was portrayed bit brighter than what it used to be when she wears dark fur color and it was proved that it was painted after 100 years And the third one is that the painter always use a single large piece of wood to portrait his paintings
65, But that painting has additional wooden pieces glued which Rembrandt never did
65,By the above three conclusions they excluded that painting out of this remembrance collection
65,Essay:I think that having friends is the most valuable asset that one can have
65, Making friends is a good habit but having presence in their life is also an important aspect
65, Always give your friends the importance what they need to get 
65,By so many instances which i came through i got to know that they are so many people who make just acquisitions for any future purposes
65, But in olden days friends were used to be like own relatives they share all their views they share their grievance and be like family members and know a days the people are more attracted towards having friends for two purposes they are one is to know as many people for prestige and the other reason is to make use of them when they want them
65, Up to me making friends matters but having good quality friend’s matters
65, So spend your free time with them make precious time count with them
65, Even when we get older the people who make acquisition with us will always expect something from us
65, So when we are in tender age the friends who are with us will never expect anything for us in return
65, So building bonds with older friends will make the relation much stronger rather than making new acquisitions those who always seek something from us for their benefit
65,So try to build relations with the people who always want to be with you and care for you and take your responsibility
65, They are so many situations where people have so many people where they have so many friends and don’t have good friends
65, So up to Search for the people who really care for you and who will be with you in harder times and make much more relations with the people whom you used to spend good times and build the relations because relations matters in everyone life rather than anything

66,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie
66, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
66, Format:MOVIE TITLE: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone WHY: The movie starts with a small boyliving in pathetic conditions
66,He was not treated well by his uncleaunt and cousin after his mother and father went to the heaven abode
66,Hesuddenlygets some magical powers and is able to revolt back against them
66,Magic is surely an escape
66,Althoughwe know that its not reasonable and pragmatic to have mystical powersbut the fact that an ordinary boy having magical powers and fighting back against the evil wrongdoings towards him moved me a lot
66,It displayed that we all have strength to overcome the malicious intentions of others
66,MOVIE TITLE: The Fault in Our Stars WHY: The movie starts with a girl suffering from cancer sharing her daily drudgery details
66,I got inspired from her the very moment I heard about her story
66,We all face some problems in life and think that we are the only ones who are unlucky enough to sail in the sea of misfortunes
66,Butas compared to this girl's(Hazel's) problemsour problems are negligible
66,She was extremely optimistic and never lose hope to live
66,Q
66, The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
66, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
66, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
66, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
66,"A famous saying goes like this : ""Excess of everything is bad"""
66,Nowadaysstudents studying in high school are already too much pressurized to get good scores
66,Parentalpeer and teacher pressure haunts them all day long
66,In such a stressful scenarioit beomes difficult for a student to perform at the best of his abilities
66,As if this wasn't alone;the school board is considering implementing a longer school day
66,The problem will be rather compounded by this action instead of alieviating their misery
66,Alsoif the school hours aren't increasedstudents get some time for indulging in activities like sportsmusicpaintingdancing etc
66, which act as an escape from the stress which a student is undergoing
66,This helps in regaining the lost energy to study even with more enthusiasm
66,Thereforeschool hours shouldn't be increased
66,Q
66," If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?When was the last time you did something for the first time?Have you ever seen a person with loads and loads of knowledge about the world and wonder ""how is he so damn smart?""?Life is all about learning through experiences and the most enriching experiences are the ones which we get from travelling to a new place"
66,Travelin the younger sortis a part of educationin the eldera part of experience
66,In my opinionwe travel not only to know about the customstraditionsnormsetc
66, of a new placewe also travel to find ourselves
66,We get to know a better insight of who we are when we travel alone
66,If I would like to go on a vacationthat will surely be a place which has a rich culture and also it should be tranquil enough to let the peace in the place settle down in my soul

66,ORIGINAL PASSAGE :When I was trolling some career websites this week I noticed that your company has a trot out for an intern this summer
66, The position sounds rad 
66, Can you shoot me back and email and tell me what’s up with the application process?CORRECTED PASSAGE :When I was browsing some career websites this week I noticed that your company has an advertisement for an intern this summer
66, The position sounds astounding 
66, Can you revert back with an email and tell me the details about the application process?
66,PASSAGE 1:The education system of the world is on the cusp of development
66,It has experienced a great shift from the conventional classroom teaching to the teaching which is highly dependent on mass communication media like the internettvetc
66,Earlierprofessors used to indulge themselves only in doing research and taking lectures for the students in their own universities
66,Nowthey not only do the conventional classroom teachingbut they also are willing to spread their knowledge through TV by giving expert commentaryappearing as guests on television news program and many such similar tasks in which they come in the foreground and impart their knowledge to the commomn people
66,Professors coming and sharing the knowledge on a platform such as a television has many advantages
66,In addition to the professor himselfthe television appearances of these professors is lucrative for the host university as welll as the common public
66,The reputation of the professor increases as the knowledge of the professor is no more confined inside the university
66,People will start recognizing the professor as by the medium of television he has a reach to greater number of people of myriad backgrounds
66,Alsothe host university is benefitted as more number of meritorious students would turn towards the university for getting admission to get quality education by professors who are erudite in their respective fields
66,This concept also has several shortcomings
66,A lot of time of the professor is wasted in preparing for the material to be presentedtravelling to and fro the place of shooting and getting ready for the appearance
66,If he gives this amount of time in his reserach and in educating studentsit will be more beneficial for eeverybody
66,Moreoveras far as the general publice is concernedthe professor has to prepare his material to be delivered with respect to the general public
66,Thereforehe avoids using subject related jargonsdue to which the actual essence of the discussion or presentation is lost
66,Everything in the world has pros and cons
66,The gist of this essay lies in balancing between the two
66,It's upto the professor whatever he decides
66,Passage 2:YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DOI disagree with statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do
66,I support my opinion with the below mentioned examples
66,Older people are retired and don't have mundane jobs to dowhich young people have
66,Most of the elderly people are paid pensions by the Central Government which is the part and parcel of their life
66,Moreoverthey don't have that much expenses so that much money is sufficent for spending their lives
66,Because they don't go to workthey have the freedom to follow their passions and fulfill all their dreams
66,For exampleA retired army officer who has worked exceptionally hard for the past 40 years of his life has the freedom to pursue his hobbieslet's sayplaying guitar
66,He has lots of time to be proficient in that and it also gives him inner satisfaction as he has fulfilled the desire or yearning which was burning inside him since many years
66,Secondlyhaving gone through all the viccisitudes of lifeusually older generation desire for relaxedpeaceful and a slow-paced life
66,They usually enjoy being at homewith their family spreading their love and wisdom

67,Altruism is the type of behaviour in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals
67, According to the lecture by sacrificing its own interest the animal harms itself because of other animals
67, The word Altruism is totally opposite of selfishness
67, By performing altruism both animals and humans they gain nothing by themselves
67, Some animals don’t share their food or anything with any other animals and as well as the humans too because they have the fear that they may harm by showing altruism
67, Unselfish acts among humans are ranging from sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members
67, Some humans don’t share their food with anyone or don’t even donate their organs to their family members too because by doing such things they might feel that it may harm them

67, Spoon feeding will be avoided if they are independent from their parents
67, By being independent from parents young adults can come to know how to mingle up with the world and people out
67, They will improve their guts and makes them grow up on their own without any help
67, But their independence from parents should not affect their future
67, They should use their independence in the right way
67, By having independence they can know the people outside much better and what’s going on with the world
67, If young adults prefer to live with their families they will be habituated to the environment of their family and can’t mingle with the outside world that easily
67, They don’t even come to know what is going on with the world but they will be safe with their parents
67, But I think we can learn more things by learning than by spoon feeding
67, So its better to live independent from parents and learn more things from the experiences being independent but that independence should not be used in a wrong way

67, By being on TV as a celebrity professors waste a lot of time
67, Most of the times they will be in TV studio rather than in the campus with the students taking lectures
67, Universities might benefit for such appearances of their professors on TV
67, They receive positive publicity such as when people see knowledgeable faculty they think more highly about university and that improves their reputation
67, Viewers have a chance to learn something new and they can experience real expertise

69,TASK 1Altruism is opposite of selfishness Altruistic behaviour of an animal benefits members of group at the peril of animal
69,But many species of animals willingly sacrifice food life to assist other members meerkat in grasslands of Africa is an example
69,Unselfish acts among us range from sharing of food to donation of organs
69,In group of meerkats a sentinel stands out looking for predators while other meerkats feed and it has to flee alone placing itself in great peril
69,Recent research suggests that sentinels eat before standing gaurd and they are near the burrow than rest of them 
69,So observing closely we can state that sentinels indeed benefit from acting on behalf of group interest
69,Also humans do get appreciation from other people by donating their organs and an increased self worth
69,So altruistic deeds do get rewarded in psychologically if not materially TASK2I personally prefer being independent 
69,Because I don't want to be dependent on them I want to do my own thing and my own way
69,As I mature into adult i want to see the world with my eyes And to form my own opinions
69, This can't happen if parents meddle into children lifestyleThey have to treat them as adults and have to give their own space
69, Other people might feel the need to have support and so seek guidance
69,Some people think it's better to navigate life being with their family
69,Having cultural difference and upbringing can result in different type of choice a teenager makes
69,For example young people in India choose to remain with their parents and sometimes refuse to join in hostels while in foreign i
69,e USA parents would send out their children as soon as they reach certain age

69,Q1
69,review on paragraghScholalrly community doesn’t take seriously who appear in tv 
69,They are going to think that it benefits professors only 
69,Also professors who appear on tv don’t discuss subject in intellectual depth as they do in university 
69,Even anchors can supplement what content the professors with little of their research
69,In lecture professor argues that serious professors do their reserch in university and by publishing in journal 
69,Thats how any professor gets reputation in acedemic community
69,Do young people enjoy more than Old people
69,Well it depends on perspective how one chooses to say what is enjoyment
69, Old people in general are not in good shape of their health
69, So they can’t travel to a place even when they want
69, But it’s going to be a problem if you think travel is only option to entertainment 
69,They can spend with their grandchildren or meet relatives to share memories
69, Old people are not lagging behind in using technology 
69,Some people like solitary moments like reading books or filing sudoku in their private time i
69,e my grandmother still likes crossword puzzles
69, They can surf net and watch Netflix online
69, They are not lagging in using technology
69, Infact being old freed their time up to pursue their hobbies or interests
69,I read in a book that by reaching old age people tend to less think what others might think of them so they have less pressure to attain anything they choose to attain
69, They tend to accumulate experiences from their life which they form a perspective
69, Lets discuss the issue this era is competitive and even young people have to burn their midnight oil to stay competitive 
69, Also we can’t say we really enjoy if we can’t take a short break from life
69, We didn’t have enough time to spend with family and friends
69, So I can’t just say young people enjoy a lot even 
69,And people enjoyment depends on ones perspective 
69, For most adults they want to spend time with family to share their experiences 
69,It’s their form of enjoyment
69,
7,Freedom means to have the right to do and say whatever you like
7,Now a days people are suffering for freedom in some places like village
7,i think of all the wars out country has foughtand still its fightningso we can have the wonderful gift of freedomthere have been many brave women and men who have risked their lifes to get freedom but we still have women and men who are fighting for freedom
7,Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible
7,because in developed countries like US and Australia people being given by freedom and stand on their feet
7,it will improve their knowledge and responsibility skills
7,they will become more independent if they stand on their own
7,they can make their own decisions and earn money
7, If young adults are being given by freedom and let their parents leave
7,And some young adults prefer to live with their own parents and family members for long time
7,at one point of view its better to stay with family
7,if any problem occurs for a single person everyone will help them
7,unity plays major role here
7,that is what our country wants
7,by staying by our family will give more encouragement and more comfortableness
7,if we grow up in our parents hand will become decipline and we stay happily and healthy
7,Some of my relatives fought in different ways like my cousins fought with their own parents to let them go out study for two years
7,but their parents did not allow them to go
7,instead of that they asked to stop studying and stay at home
7,in some villages young adults are suffering with freedom
7,I support staying out of home and learning things and feed food on our own make our country better
7,everybody should stand on their own without depending on someone
7, everybody should stand on their own without depending on someone
7,freedom is gift that should earn by ourselfOften the science has found four section examNow studies and their behaviour is became much more costly then otherThe interesting thing was found like eating habitsOnce upon a time the guard had heavy stomach acheAfter he run immediately to burn after the alarmOne man looking for food he is actually in dangerAlarm might cause to other team and they will move out quicklyIt will increase animals from survivalsWhat about people? A person might be a relative or stranger Downer will consider it very valuable for some peopleBut some people won’t get rewards from some strangers

7,Character: A college student
7,Setting: A college library
7,Time: late at night
7,Situation : A death has occurred
7, When I was in college used to go library in the nights because I was very studious that time 
7,As we were given a huge assignment’s every day we couldn’t get time to go to library in the college hours
7,Our library was same like a palace
7, Everybody wants go and study over there
7, We can find Many subject books novels newspapers were available there 
7,Actually to be frank i used to go there to visit that peaceful place every day because when it is very calm I concentrate on what I study 
7, There was a rowdy gang in my college who fights with faculty and other branch students
7, They got a bad name from entire college
7,one day that gang was ragging a junior who just joined in the college 1 week back
7, The name who undergone with torture was Rana he is very intelligent and smart looking
7,Rana was tortured by the rowdy gang and from that moment he suddenly disappeared from the college
7, Principle and friends tried calling him but couldn’t find him
7, The college library has closed because of this issue
7, And I came to know that one junior was missing and he is the fresher
7, As everyone knew that rowdy gang have done some murders before in the college students started blaming them for this too
7, However I took it light and as usual I went to college library to see whether the it is opened yet or not
7,Luckly library was reopened and I started reading books like I do daily
7, Suddenly some student was screaming like anything
7, Everybody in the library went and saw the situation
7, Guess what? They found one dead body in the corner of library
7, As I said you the library was like a palace it is not possible to see each corner of Library
7, And the most shocking new to the entire college was that the dead body that they found was the person who tortured by the rowdy gang
7, Yes he was Rana
7,He died because that rowdy gang has done a embarrassing task to rag him so he decided to do suicide

7,WRITING BASED ON READING AND LISTENING:The professors are normally found in universitys classroomsofficersand libraries doing research and lecturing to their students
7,and they appear as guests on television news progrmsgiving expert commentary on latest event in the world
7,But in lecture they oppose that the famous professors in universities may not be invited to TV’s
7,Its not good for professors to waste their important time on Tv that will prove their standards
7,The lecturer who is a great professor or senior professor may not be invited to Tv’s
7,These tv appearances are not benefited to the professors themselves as well as to their universities and the general public
7, When the professors share their ideas with a television audience the professors importance as scholors not enhanced
7,Universities will loose the positive opinion on professors because being a good professor he may not spend his valuable time on television
7,When people see a knowledge faculty member of a university on television they think that he is not utilizing his time on students rather then he his wasting his time on tv
7,Finallythe public gains the knowledge but the professors loose his valuable time on tv’s
7,there is no need to showing faculty themselves on televisions 
7,Young people enjoy their life more than older people doEveryone has his/her own opinion about certain things
7, Everybody has their own tastes
7, May be some people think that it’s not true that older people enjoy their life less than the young people do
7, But it is correct that the young people feel great life happiness than older people
7,First of all young people have so many advantages like we learn faster and our intellect is broader and richer than the old person
7, Because it’s just a beginning of our life we have to learn and have more fun in this beautiful stage of life
7, But as for old people they had experience in their lives they are not expecting anything because they already felt them
7, There nothing more interesting things in their future life
7,Secondly we should agree with the reality that younger people look beautiful and better
7, Well we cannot do anything in this matter
7, It’s the law of nature that humans get older and older
7, Childhood always described as a time of sincere happiness time when there are no serious problems and worries
7,it is the best to leave in their imaginative world
7,Thirdly on earth there are people who reach happiness in an advanced age
7, Like for example if I take a real life incident I have met a couple who get married at 60 years old
7, It's not that common but it exists
7,  I think the best example and the saddest one is the people who suffer of a disease
7, Young middle-aged old they all enjoy life as much as they can and that is the beauty of life
7, You don't have to wait to be happy or enjoy at a precise moment
7, You just do
7,Thus everyone can enjoy life regardless the age it's just a question of attitude and personality
7, Though there are passages in your life (students retired persons) which can lead you to different kind of joy
7, The joy stays the same it's just your conception who changed

7,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie
7, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
7,Format:MOVIE TITLE: BahubaliWHY: The movie starts off with Shivagami a queen exiting a cave
7, She is seen holding a baby close to her chest
7, Two soldiers exit the cave after her and seem to be following the queen
7, The queen then cleverly kills the two soldiers but looses the strength to run any farther
7, She then prays to the gods for the baby to survive keeping her life on the line
7,I find the opening of this movie memorable as the actor who portrayed the role as the queen did a very good job
7, The role itself was shown to be courageous and loving throught the scene
7, It shows a mother’s caring and love to save her baby from evil
7, MOVIE TITLE : Wolverine WHY: The movie starts in Nagasaki at the time when a nuclear bomb was dropped on it
7, Logan along with his ally start running as the enemy starts raining bombs on them
7, Logan finds a sewer that he thinks would be perfect for them to escape the bombardment
7, They enter the sewer but when the nuclear bomb is dropped Logan places himself in front of his ally and protects him from the fire
7, Logan’s body is burnt but it slowly starts regenerating thus revealing that Logan is a mutant
7,The opening shows good graphics and makes the audience believe that it was filmed during war
7, The graphics are very good and the helping nature and abilities of the main character is perfectly shown
7,QUESTION 2:1
7,    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
7, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
7, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
7, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longerESSAY 1My family is saving and planning for two incredible adventures Very beautiful question indeed
7, I shall first like to travel the whole of my country
7, I mean almost the whole
7, As nobody can do it one single lifetime
7, If you mean foreign country- then russia anytime
7, I just love that cold dark country
7,they are so womanly and know how to seduce a man
7, Another factor being the cultural similarity with us Indians
7, Russians tend to connect on the same emotional level like Indians If not above them which I guess nobody can
7, Lol
7,I think we Indians could do that Again like we did in ancient times
7, And ofcourse there is Tatar finno- Ugric Siberia far east beauties too
7,
7, But I love this place
7, So Russia central Asia Canada Australia eastern Europe Venice Paris and Switzerland Columbia Latin America( brazil) for me
7,ESSAY 2 The school day should be not longer and more universal in start times
7, Summer vacation is a throwback to when the United States was an agricultural economy
7, Kids need to be in school longer and need to be learning the skills that relate to today's job market
7, But as point of view the time limit of schools should decrease and education is part of learning but not a life
7, The government needs to step up and increase education funding
7, In turn teachers should be banned from unionizing but have their pay increased so they are paid like the professionals they are supposed to be
7, I would pay teachers a minimum of $70000 a year but no job security and no tenure
7, They would be made to reapply for their jobs every year and the decision to hire them back would be based on how well the students are learning
7, Each school should only have one principal and one vice principle
7, Here in Los Angeles we have schools with 10 vice principals
7, Christie has a good idea but it should be part of a larger reform package
7, Right now our schools are failing our kids
7, It does not have to be this way
7, China sends their kids to school at least 10 hours a day and there is no such thing as summer vacation
7, The rest of the world is laughing at us
7, The United States is like that middle aged guy who works some dead end job but all he talks about is the 4 touchdowns he scored in the high school championship game
7, America is no longer exceptional when it comes to educating its children

7, (7)Additional example a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class
7, (8)Another source would be television shows on the topic of communication
7, (9)Third major idea college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment
7, (10)Example lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills
7, (11) Additional example a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; (12) moreover reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases
7, (13) Moreover college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments

70,This is very ridiculous
70, As a result from not receiving efficient sleep students are not able to be alert and knowledgeable during lessons in school which weakens their education and learning as a whole
70, As a solution to this well-recognized concern the length of a school day should be altered for number of reasons
70, As a major point by shortening the school days students would have the ability to manage their time properly

70,Advantages and Disadvantages of Professors on TV showThere are two different views explained in passage and on video 
70,This was completely about advantages and disadvantages of professors on television in daily life
70, The professors who appear on television are unable to spend more time in university as they need to spend lot of time in front of cameras instead of classrooms
70, But professors who appear on TV get more popularity in people and also get lots of reanimations for the valuable statements made by them on shows
70,By this the professors who are not more published or popular is going to come out and show his or her skills to the common world
70, These kinds of professors are not invited to great conferences
70, Knowledge is power
70, People with high qualifications think that TV shows is much concentrating on the materials used by person or university where they work rather than stuff
70,"TV shows give more importance to ""Title rather than Material """
70,In my view it is not required to show talent of person in front of everybody
70, We need to prove ourselves when we are in a challenge
70,”I believe knowledge is power
70, I don’t have people to relay on so I have to be self-sufficient”
70,Yes I do agree with the statement that young age people make much fun in their lives 
70,It actually do not depend on age whether we enjoy in our life or not but during young age people do not really have to answer for anything that they do
70, People in this age have no other responsibilities other than achieving goals to have a bright future
70, People must also have enjoyment in acquiring goals in their life
70, Young people attract more towards friends and having fun 
70,In young age our surroundings and health conditions also helps us more to enjoy more during young age
70,But people can even have lots of enjoyment in old age
70, For example if we take Mickle Jackson who is famous all around the world 
70,He not only enjoyed during his young age but also made miracles in old age
70,But to have a bright and colourful future we need to enjoy our young age my achieving goals and by facing lots of challenges 
70,In young age we enjoy every moment of life because everything is new and fun to make
70, Actually we make lots of memories in young age with our friends and college days remains us much joy in our lives
70, We make comments on people we bunk classes we will go for trips with friends we spend lots of time to read novels we enjoy a lot during young age
70, You should have a criteria to enjoy by achieving goals to have a bright future that will never lead us to problems during old age
70,Finally I conclude saying that young is probably good time to enjoy
70, One should enjoy lot during young age that remains as memories in old age

70,Task 1:Selfishness is quite opposite to altruism where one of them deals with extreme great job and the other deals with an issue where animals sacrifice themselves to be part of food for some others
70,It is found that meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrow s of Africa is a great example 
70,In this kind they kill themselves to be part of others food and on other side we found predators which are in hunt 
70,In humans also we have some people who donate body parts for others where those kind of people are praised a lot and get lots of regards from others
70, As they give life for a new person
70,Whereas animals are not given such kind of importance but they assist themselves to be part of our food
70, So altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of meerkats groupEASSY:Being a young adult i do support with the second option that is young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time
70, In my point of view parents are visible god to us 
70,They are the one who sacrifice their whole life to make us happy
70, Family is one which dont tend to expect anything from us intend 
70,It is a place where we don't need to act good in front of others and a place where we have our own freedom
70, Actually i give much importance to family in my life
70, It would be very courageous to be part of great family 
70, Parents are one who gives and everything and expects nothing from children except love 
70,And is our duty to be part of their life during old age and help them to keep helping when they are in need of us
70, We must treat them as our kids when we grow up and what they need is our love and caring
70,I think it better to live with a family where we have lots of fun and much effections
70,For suppose if u are having a couple of kids at home what all they do is just have a laptop or a mobile and starts surfing to internet or playing games
70, Other than that they can't know any moral values 
70,Suppose if your kids are in a joint family they have their cousins to plat they have their grandparents to know stories 
70,If both are working in a small family we need to drop our kids in play schools but i think that is not going to be a right way to grow my children being part of my life
70, Parents do lot for us and it is our duty o help them when they are in need and it is not just like need it is our duty to take care of them
70, Everybody love their parents but leaving them helpless and moving to other place to have fun does not make any sense to me
70,What is the need to stay away from familiy?If it is just for money that money does not give any life or hapiness to u but if u be happy with your family and make it fruit basket
70,"Here by i conclude that with a statement that ""Be happy with your parents and give a happy life to your children by staying in a family that would make your life great and high"""

71,Here the author is comparing the behavior among mammals and even in humans
71,He says that altruism is a type of behavior where an animal sacrifies its own interest to another animal or other group of animals
71,In this he tells about groups of Meerat that if a group of meerat goes for a hunt then one among that is going to look for any predator while the others hunt
71, By standing guard it gains nothing it goes without food and even stands in danger but the animals in group can do more than they are in single
71, It protects other lives from danger This is like an example to say how the altruistic sentinel behavior towards others
71,Author also say that some humans will donate their organs to their family members or for any strangers too
71,Author wants to focus on altruism behavior in humans and even in mammals that means he wants to say they are some kind who always care for other and they are of opposite to selfish nature and want to offer help and even they sacrifice their own interest
71, So the altruistic behavior helps ensure the survival of other members
71,#writing-2Getting a thought to be independent is good because one should be more independent
71,He/she shouldn’t depend on others here depending is—They should get their things ready and should have knowledge on what they are doing
71,According to me being independent from their family is like appreciating because they will be knowing how to behave with others and how to mingle and how to tackle others how to face problems and even how to get the solution for that
71,This is want actuall independent is
71,Being independent makes one to learn many things like I already mentioned they will know how to behave speak and even face others which are the most important things to be learned in one’s life
71,One shouldn’t take advantage of being independent and they shouldn’t forget their moral values what their family had made them to learn these many days
71,By being independent they even more make their life beautiful they can plan more effectively
71,At first or in the beginning they mayn’t handle properly but after that they can schedule properly and will know how to plan their life
71,Most of the adults will do this with the help of their parents or families but for me its not correc tbecause it’s our life we need to lead it so decision must be taken by us
71, We need to plan those we can ask for suggestions but couldn’t depend on others for decision
71,So being independent makes us to learn many things and even helps to lay a good path
71,we ourselves should lead our life no one helps us so if we’re independent from beginning we can make our life easy and can get solution even in the worst situations
71,This is want we really want in life and this makes us to be brave enough to handle the worst situations too and this means we’re succeed in journey of lifethis is what a true success is and every man need this
71, TASK: 1Meerkats are really not so self less as mentioned in passage because they are the one who eat first among all and act as guard
71,But it was mentioned in the passage that they sacrifice their life for others and act as guard
71, whenever the predator comes their job is to alert the other Meerkats But in the content it was mentioned that being guard they have a great advantage to escape from the predator because they stand on barriers while others search for food so they can escape into burrows before anyone can
71,In the content it was mentioned that even humans does not donate donate blood or organs selflessly
71, They gain some or the other sort of appreciation in the form of money or appraisal
71, But in passage it was quite opposite where some people Meerkats and Mammals are expected to do the things without any returns
71, There are very few persons who donate their organs without expectations
71, But some don’t
71, Humans expect things in return of favour may be in the situation where their own relatives are in danger
71, So there is no point in things that Meerkats and humans act selflessly
71,The situation differs where people do the things in selfishness and being self-centered
71, The moto may be positive but the intension is negative
71,Task: 2The issue is about does young adults prefer to be with their parents or like to be independent
71, In my point of view there are advantages as well disadvantages in both the points
71, The young adults like independence rather than being with their parents because there is one to question that person for whatever he does
71, There is no form of interference in their personal life
71, These young adults feel free to do the things
71, They lead the life in their own way
71, The have very less sentimental values
71, But in some situation in life this sort of attitude makes the life very complicated
71, There are many cases where the chance of miss leading is higher compared to be right
71, There will be no proper person to guide about what is really good and bad
71, Or no elder one who can suggest opinions for any decision that young people take
71, Elders are considered to be very experienced
71, They can be guides for young people
71, But in some cases the issue is quite opposite
71, Where the young want to be with their parents
71, In this case the young become dependent
71, They may can’t do the things independently or take decisions independently
71, And in some situations young people still may want to live with their parents but they cannot because of many situations like their studies job or may because of marital problems etc
71, In my point of view I support to the second situation
71, There may be any reason for young to be stay away with their parents these reasons are for temporary
71, Only for some period of time these young stay but they finally stay with their parents
71, Bonding in between the people increases
71, There is supportive guide at the back
71, Young can be more religious and can have family oriented mindsets
71, Only blessed can live with their parents in their life

71, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
71, Every school board should give the equal importance to the study and sports because along with the studies the sports also plays a very crucial role in one’s student life

72,The group of meerkat mammals will alarm each other by making crying sound to escape from predator where they are group together to save each other life from predator
72, There is another example of altruism that is about humans
72, People who sacrifice their own food or organ of their body will not be appreciated or rewarded for their good deed
72, A person is precious and valuable and someone who is sacrificing their life for others should be rewarded
72,TASK-2The topic is about independence or dependence of living with their families for some young adults
72, There are some adults who have different perspective towards life which they had probably reflect in their career life
72, The most important thing is to take decision where the individual thinks about life
72,In my point of view young adult should be prefer to live with families for longer time as there is so much to learn from them which may not result the same by living or staying away from them
72, For example people who stay away or want independence from their parents probably will be facing more difficulties like staying health issues bad accompany influenced bad habits and so on where no one will be there to teach them
72, So finally I would like to conclude by saying staying with families will be better than being away from them

73,Professors attending to the tv show is a sensitive issue that changes from the professor to professor according to the video the important points which are raised in order to oppose the program of professor for a tv show areIts mostly believed that the professors who are no up to the mark may get some reputation that the existing ones even though he’s is not eligible to that due to his wrong delivery of information there may be miss communication between the listeners and the subject the tv professors are not allowed for seminars and he may not be supported with funds for his research the TV professors waste time by travelling here and there even for their makeup etcinstead of wasting that time they can spend it in the university and help the students tv networks doesn’t need must depth subject so the tv professors may leave the topic abruptly and jump into some other business so its better for the serious professors no to attend the TV lectures and instead of that helping students will be good enough
73,
73,I completely agree with the statement that the “young people enjoy life more than the old do” for several reasons
73, Coming to the first point the young have many ways to enjoy their life than the older ones
73, Technology provides the younger ones to enjoy more and relax in different ways
73, Internet is very popular and common among the young people for those who want to enjoy we face many social websites to chat and for being refreshed but it is not common among the older
73, With the available of the new technology the young have more different choices to enjoy their lives than the older do
73, But in the prospective of the older ones the young have less limitation to enjoy their life than the older do
73, For example the young have stronger body and more energy than the older do
73, They can go rock-climbing which requires a lot of concentration and body strength
73, They can go for bike races and they can participate in any sport in which they are interested but that doesn’t work with older ones because they may have some limitations with respective to age they may have health issues also
73, Thinking with flexibility leads people more fit in their life
73, Older people sometimes consider based on too much experiences and principles while younger people think more creative
73, Thinking out of the box helps people to live a better life because they do not have too much use prejudice to evaluate and make decisions
73, Therefore these people not following rules always can experience some surprises and live a more colourful life
73, So in my point of view it’s clear that the younger will enjoy more than the older ones
73,
73,TASK1: ABOUT ALTRUISMAltruism is completely opposite to selfishness
73, Meerkat animal is use to sacrifice itself for its group an individual acts as a sentinel in order to protect the other members
73, once it come to know the danger which is going to happen it simply gives a signal to its group and flees as soon as possible into the burrow the remaining group may scatter suddenly or come together to battle against the enemy not only in the animals even in human beings altruism is found they are many people who are very kind and helpful in nature they help a lot of people even to the strangers examples like blood donors organ donors etc
73, to unknown persons
73, Even though they won’t get any appreciation do you think they doesn’t deserve it doesn’t matter the type of help they do they are very kind hearted towards other people at least for that they have to be appreciated the awards or appreciation may be non-material but they have to thanked for something for what they have did
73,TASK2: ADULTS SHOULD STAY WITH PARENTS OR BE INDEPENDENTMy stand on this particular topic is neutral because there are pros and cons on both the sides children want independence from their parents in order to explore their dreams they don’t want to be guided because they think they are good enough in handling situations and contemporary to that parents are also allow their child’s to such type of situations because they want their children to what exactly life is and how it is going to create hurdles in the progress of career
73,This is only on the one side of the coin the remaining people want to live with their families due to effective or they need their assistance etc
73, and parents also want their children to be with them due to many reasons there are pros and cons for both the choices if we move with the pros in the independence from the parents children are free from parental pressure and they can explore what they want and can achieve what they want without any barriers
73, In the cons you will have many reasons like if the adults are away from parents they may tilt towards many wrong directions and may end up with different problems
73,Coming to the aspect of staying with their parents they may be restricted to some levels where they cannot explore what they want to do in the life it may lead to serious mental depression which may lead to serious problems
73, Many adults are still facing the issues with their parents if there is no flexibility with their parents then it is not a good option to be with the parents because it may hurt him and his family and at the same time if a guy is not having any sought of goal in their life and if he is prone to bad things in his life
73,So it depends on the personality of the adult whether to be or not be with the parents

74,According to the passage Professors are usually present in universitiesclassroomsand they are found doing some research and lecturing students
74, And not only as a lectures in universities they even appear in televisions as guests to talk about important topics and to give more information or knowledge about the things around the world
74, There are both advantages and disadvantages to the professors by doing so
74,Firstly coming to the advantages professors will acquire reputation when they appear on television because there will be more number of viewers in front of television when compared to a classroom even the university in which the professor teaches also gains fame then finally improved fame can increase the donation and funds to universities
74, Not only the professors and universities but also people will get benifitedbecause they will come know many thing which they don’t know they will acquire more knowledge by interacting with professors on television directly
74,Secondly coming to the disadvantages professors who appear in the television are mostly not allowed to highly educational meetings
74, And also people have perception that professors do it for money
74, And the professors won’t get enough time to teach in the institutions
74, Finally the public will also not be much benefited because the TV channels only want professors to speak brief about any topic so public won’t get total clarity on the topic
74,And with a conclusion that professors who appear on the TV will have advantages as well as disadvantages

74,
74,Opinion mostly depends on the surroundings and in the culture we are grown in
74, For example if we consider other American and European countries young people mostly don’t live with their parents they value more for their independence but coming to Asians countries mostly in India we value our relationships
74,There are many reasons why many young people want to stay with their parents the main reason is that they want to support their family and parents when they become old But people who live their family lack their individuality and freedom
74, So some people choose to live their own lies to enjoy the freedom
74,When people live away from their family they lack the moral support from the family members
74, Staying away from will have both advantages and disadvantages in my opinion that there are more advantages compared to the disadvantages
74, On the other hand when people stay away from the family they will be exposed to bad companies which will lead them to bad habits and destroy their career
74, Altruism is the opposite of selfishness if it is an animal or an individual performing altruism gain nothing for themselves
74, Altruism abounds both among humans and other mammals
74, Sharing of food with strangers donation of body organs to family members and even to strangers come under altruism acts
74, Not only humans perform altruism in fact many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group
74, We can take meerkatas an example meerkat is an mammal which lives in grassland areas of Africa In the group of meerkatsan individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained
74, Even it acts as a standing guard when meerkat sees a predator such as hawk it gives an alarm cry alert to make other meerkats to run and seek shelter by altruism acts meerkat gains nothing instead it places itself in the grave danger
74, So the altruistic behaviour helps ensure the survival of other members in the group

74,Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I want to go on a vacation I would choose Kerala which is in southern part of India
74, When I was in my 7th standard my best friend went to Kerala tour with her family she came back and described kerala in such a way that I was really mesmerized
74,From that day kerala has become my dream vacation to go
74,I was attracted to that place because I really like greenery and I am basically nature lover
74,I have read in many articles that kerala is one of the greenest place in the world
74,There ary many number of beautiful lakes and ponds present in kerala which makes kerala more special
74,Kerala is also known as God’s own land
74,Oman is kerala famous festivalwhich is celebrated with beautiful lights across tha state kerala looks more beautiful in the month of onam
74,I wish I would visit kerala in month of onam
74,Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
74, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
74, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
74, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
74,According to my point of view school day should not be longer because it affects the sport practices
74, Others may think that by increasing the school day longer students will get more time to study but the fact is that when the study hours are increased students tend to lose their interest in studieswhen the study hours are continues without any break or without any sports hours students get frustrated
74,Scientists have proven that students participating in sports and in other activities tend to have more interest even in studies
74,If students spent most of the time in school then when they are going to spend time with family members
74,Even family values are important for the students to development themselves
74, When school hours are increased students get more stressed and when they come back to home they lose interest in everything and they feel depressed
74,I conclude by saying that students are not machines to work or study longer so study hours should not be longer
74,Orange Movie Intro:Orange movie is one of my favourite movies with a feel good story and also feel good scenes

75, In the same way speaker feels that even humans donate their organs for non-materialistic appreciation which is more valuable but passage states that donation is completely selfless act which they perform for their personal satisfaction however they may receive little reward
75, Therefore we may conclude that passage and lecture are completely differing in their ideology
75,Living away from parents for certain period in life will definitely fetch better experiences helps you to learn how to deal with different people doing our own tasks without anyone’s help have self control
75, However I suggest this must be only for certain span in our life because parents will be happy and satisfied when their children are with them in their later part of life
75, Coming out of comfort knowing the how brutal the world is!! is essential in everyone’s life
75, Staying away from the people who guard makes you learn how to protect yourself to be independent and to learn beautiful roses have thones but at the same time but must be restricted to certain time
75, Enjoying with friends weekend parties having fun may be fascinating in the beginning but very soon everyone have their family to look after you are left alone when it comes to choose between you and their family
75, So family especially parents must never be ignored they are with you no matter what
75, They neither judge you with your success nor leave if you are a loser
75, They just love the way you are
75, Therefore I suggest enjoy with friends stay away from home for a while to get experience of how to manage things alone but don’t leave family forever take up the responsibilities when you have to and be an asset to your family

75,The speaker in the lecture is mainly about real benefits of a professor attending the TV shows which is completely opposing the idea in passage
75, Firstly the speaker says its neither advantageous to professor nor audience
75, The students or the university dont get benefitted by this
75, Coming to professor he may not get inivitation to any of the important desicions considering him not serious about research
75,He may not get funds for research
75, He may gain reputation among fellow professors but that would be definitely in negative way
75,It may result in lot of time being wasted like time to travel get ready to shoot
75, However knowledgeable the professor is the audience are neither interested to listen to sophisticated deeper insight of the topic nor in the complete analysis audience just require brief entertaining content which a TV reporter can give
75,But in the passage its completely in contradiction
75, The author here admits that professor gains reputationhe gets satisfied for enlightening the public with his speech
75, The people outside the narrow world of education would know about the topic
75, Coming to students and unversity according to the speech they are ultimate loser as the professor may not find time to them as he would be busy with shooting schedules which is completely in disagreement to audio
75,In audio the orator said the university is benefited the most as viewers believe that university has knowledgeable faculty which in turn increases donationsmore applications from potential students
75, Therefore I conclude that passage and the audio differ completely in ideology
75, I like age is never a hurdle to enjoy when you are ready to take things as they come in life
75, In matter what if you are prepared to take the challenge then everything is fun

76,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another anima or group of animals
76, Altruism is the opposite of selfishness: individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves
76, Examples of altruism abound both among humans and among other mammals
76, Unselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members and even to strangers
76, Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another yet provide little reward to the one performing the act
76,In fact many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group
76, The meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa is often cited as an example
76, in groups of meerkats an individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hut for food or eat food they have obtained
76, If the sentinel meerkat seems a predator such as a hawk approaching the group 
76,it gives alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to rum and to rum and seek shelter
76, By standing guard the sentinel meerkat gains nothing –it goes without food while the others eat and it places itself in grave danger
76, After it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it more at risk to a predator since animals in groups are often able to work together to fend off a predator
76, So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkats group
76,In these day of course some young adults want independence from their parents and some other young adults prefer to live with their families for a long time
76, Both are individual and have separate reasons

76, Because they think happiness is only with family
76, By birth they live with family
76,In my opinion staying with family is best because family is first school of learning 
76,in family every interaction can give happiness

77, They think that it’s enough to enjoy with their family the remaining life but it’s wrong with the friends we can share our happiness and sadness
77, Young people can go anywhere that may be different states and countries and they will enjoy a lot
77, Old people will also go to different places but the enjoyment will be very less when compared to the young people
77, Young people will enjoy more when compared to old people with family and friends
77, Young people enjoy their happiness in doing work enjoying with friends colleagues and families
77, They will enjoy every moment in their life with happiness and sadness
77, So in my view Young people will enjoy more when compared to the old people

78,All large software development projects irrespective of application generate a large amount of associated documentation
78, For moderately sized systems the documentation will probably fill several filing cabinets; for large systems it may fill several rooms
78, A high proportion of software process costs is incurred in producing this documentation
78, Furthermore documentation errors and omissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption
78, Therefore managers and software engineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associated costs as to the development of the software itself
78, Process documentationProduct documentation
78,Process documentation These documents record the process of development and maintenance
78, Plans schedules process quality documents and organizational and project standards are processThe major characteristic of process documentation is that most of it becomes outdated

78,From the reading passage we get to know that professors benefit a lot when they appear on T
78,V Like as follows The university and the professor’s reputation will increase because of the TV appearanceMore number of students join the university 
78, Whereas the lecture tells us that the professors face a lot of problems because of TV appearance like as follows
78,The professors may not be able to attend conferences because of his/her TV appearances
78,The professors may use most of his time for TV rehearsals and presentations which can be used for clearing students doubts and for their research purposeThe professors may not be invited to important academic meetings
78,In the passage it’s given that because of TV appearance the professors ideas and knowledge reaches wide number of people compare to academic students
78,But in the lecture it is given that in TV appearance the professors cannot deliver the in-depth topic to audience as they will have limited time to convey their ideas
78,
79,In the lecture the professor’s view on appearing on television is not beneficial for both university and the public
79, The reasons that she stated are belowIf a professor is not a serious researcher he will do entertainment on television instead of a class
79,It is a lot of tome waste to the professor
79, He should spend a lot of time on makeup travelling preparing for the lecture and rehearsal of the lecture
79,It is also a problem to the university because the professor is spending valuable time on television rather than in the university
79,If he delivers a lecture on TV then the audience don’t understand in depth concepts
79, The just look at the title of the work
79,The information provided by the professor is a historical facts and analysis of the topic
79, It is same to the script of a journalist who does a little home work
79,But in the passage it was contradicted that these lectures can benefit the public and increase the reputation of the professor
79, It can also attract many students to join the university
79, If a lecture was given in a college journal only other scholars will learn
79, But if it was given on TV then even public knows a lot
79,As a coin has two faces both young people and older people enjoy their life and struggle as well
79,If we consider the case of younger people on one side of the coin they enjoy a lot
79, They can play games go to movies and eat whatever they want without any restrictions
79, They can go out for parties etc
79, But the enjoyment is not limited only to parties and movies
79, They can also be with loved ones
79, Life looks beautiful as they have a lot of strength and time
79, On the other side of the coin at this age some of the younger generation struggle a lot because of the stress put on them by their parents
79, Their career related problems and financial problems etc
79,If we consider the case of older people on one side of a coin they have experienced a lot of hurdles they worked hard for their children and establishing a good career to their children
79, They worked day and night to build a dream home and finally they retire from all these responsibilities and enjoy their rest of life happily playing with their grand children
79, On the other side of the coin if the older people have no support after they get old they find it difficult to manage
79, They can’t eat everything because of the health restrictions
79, Many suffer from health problems
79, If they are not loved by their children they will literally see a hell spending their lives in old age homes
79, Finally I would like to conclude that both the young age people and old age people have many joyful moments and also a lot of struggles
79, If one simply don’t get stuck at a point in life and just keep going on then everyone will enjoy their life irrespective of their age

79, Arun – will you follow up with Hasmitha over email to set up a phone call? ThanksKalyan
79,In the lecture the professor spoke about altruism
79,She stated the example of Meerkuts a kind of animals which live in the grasslands of Africa
79, She told that there is a sentinel meerkut which guards the group
79,Before going to guard they have stomach full of food
79, But other animals which hunt for food stay with hunger
79, When a predator is approaching it makes an alarm
79, Since it is nearer to the burrow it escapes immediately by going into the burrow
79, But the sound it makes leaves the other animals in danger
79,It sees for its own survival at the cost of lives of other animals
79,Some altruists donate their kidneys expecting for nothing
79,But they will return some appreciation or reward in return
79,Facts stated in the passage/The sentinel meerkut doesn’t have a meal before it goes for guard while all other animals are in search of food
79, So the sentinel has to suffer from humger
79, Also when a predator is observed by the sentinel meerkut it makes an alarm for the other meeerkuts to be alert and escape
79, But the sound made by the sentinel leaves it in danger
79, It may be targeted by the predator and sometimes it may also die
79,The professor actually opposed many facts which are stated in the passage
79, In the passage the sentinel meerkut was stated as an altruist which scrifices its life for the sake of others
79, But in the lecture given by the professor he stated the guard meerkut as a selfish animal leaving its grouop in danger
79,Question 1:Title: The Legend of Bhagat Singh
79,Why: The Titles are given with the agitations of people and speeches of great leaders
79, After the titles are finished in the opening scene a group of people are doing agitations in front of the jail
79, They praise Bhagat Singh
79, Meanwhile at the backside of the jail the police breaks the wall and moves three dead bodies from jail in a van
79, They stop a river bank and slice the bodies into pieces and burn them with petrol
79, The public knew this and rushed towards the area
79, The three dead bodies are Bhagat Singh SukhDev and RajGuru
79, So this creates a curiosity in the audience
79,Question 2:Essay 1: If you can go on a vacation anywhere in the world where would you go? We get bored sometimes with our daily routine and work
79, The best way to get out of this routine work is to go out for a vacation
79, Whenever I feel tired of my daily routine I prefer to go on a vacation
79, Do you know that going on a vacation reduces your stress and makes you refreshed? But it happens only when you forget your mobile

79, My favourite holiday spot is Darjeeling
79, Darjeeling is located in Shimla just below the great Himalayan Range
79, It is one of the best pilgrimage destinations
79, It is well known for its pleasant climate and beautiful landscapes
79, The morning in Darjeeling is a wonderful sight
79, The entire landscape is covered with fog
79, It has various places to explore
79, Moreover it is famous for different varieties of tea and medicinal herbs
79, The Darjeeling tea estates are very beautiful to look at
79, We can enjoy our day with the dances and performances of the local tribes
79, Their food varieties are just awesome
79, For those who are trying to escape out of this polluted environment and want to refresh yourself and escape from this hot temperatures Darjeeling is the best place
79,Essay 2: Opinion on the school decision Now a days parents and schools concentrate mainly on studies and bypass sports and extracurricular activities
79, Studies are important for our career but even sports have an equal weightage in one’s life
79, Classroom activities assignments science and math are required for a child
79, But they should not be forced
79, An interest should be created in the child
79, This interest comes out of a peaceful and happy mind
79, Sports and other hobbies help a child to develop himself beyond education
79, Moreover sports makes one’s mind very active and stress free which can again create interest in studies
79, So education is important but without sports it is useless
79, It doesn’t make a perfect student

8,Hello Sir I am Anuhya currently working on the project related to online shopping
8, Basically we’ve to go to different shops to purchase our goods based on our requirements
8, It’s very difficult for us to find time for shopping
8, As the technology is improved we have an idea to develop an application which works on different platforms from which customer can shop all the goods irrespective of the category such as groceries fruits and veggies crockery fashion electronic goods etc
8, Customer can pick the goods add to the cart and proceed
8, In addition we also add points on every purchase to customer’s account which can be used later
8, Moreover COD is also applicable depending upon the goods
8, This is the latest technology which would be an innovative idea
8, Expecting a positive reply from you

8,TASK-1Julian Treasure a sound and communication expert is a top rated international (TED) speaker and “How to speak so that people want to listen” is one of the top twenty TED talks of all the time
8, In this talk he speaks not only about different senses of speaking to be avoided but also about the powerful foundations that are required while one speak
8,There are seven deadly senses of speaking that every person need to avoid
8, They are:Gossip
8,Judging
8,Negativity
8,Complaining
8,Excuses
8,Exaggeration
8,Dogmatism
8,Gossiping is nothing but talking about a person who is not present which is not a good habit
8, Judging a person is very hard because in order to judge a person one must listen to his/her speech very carefully
8, Also it is very hard for a person to listen if he knows that he is going to be judged by other person
8, Negativity complaining and excuses are also to be avoided
8, One must never exaggerate sometimes it may lead to lying
8, Dogmatism is confusing of facts with opinions
8,There are four powerful foundations to be followed “HAIL”
8, H-HonestyA-AuthenticityI-Integrity and L-LoveOne must be straight and clear enough absolute honesty is not required at some times
8, Be yourself and maintain your word while delivering your speech
8, Finally wish everybody well with Love
8,Julian Treasure also mentioned about 6 exercises for arms lips tongue and making sound(v-o) which he usually perform before delivering a speech to a gathering
8, Finally he conclude that speaking powerfully to people who are listening carefully in an environment which actually fit for sounds beautiful and understanding will be the norm

80,Ruby Molly MathewsIITH-105ESSAYAdults the ones who have just completed their rebellious phase of life and have stepped into sanity to an extent
80, They either have boiling blood or glitter running through their veins with a determination to rattle the stars to achieve what they want in life
80,Perspective of every individual changes in every area once he stones adulthood he gets clarity in life and speaks sense to an extent
80, His scenarios and circumstances during his period of growth would make him more attached or detached from family his battles would have either made him a warrior for good or would have shattered him into pieces for bad
80,According to me living with family is the best choice
80, Family they are the ones who have seen you fly seen you fall picked you up when you were low stood by you in every battle yet never lost faith in you they have been a part of all your high and low tides of life
80, They don’t succumb you to things nor do they get sarcastic with you infact they only get all the more encouraging to make you reach heights in life
80, Family always stands as a spine to see you stand tall in all situations as a shield from all 
80, They definetly play a huge role in chistling you to a masterpiece that you are today they help you carve a nitch for yourself their support definetly leave an indelible mark in the sands of time
80,What more good would it be than waking up next to such a beautiful blessing every dawnWe need to treasure them and every moment with them instead of taking family for granted they alone are the precious ones who will quench our thirst to meaning of life for indeed they add a whole new meaning to life Family indeed makes you a better person to make this world a better place to live in
80,Ruby Molly MathewsIITH-105SUMMARYAltruism is an audacious act of being unselfish and generous in the acts one does regardless of being petrified of the consequences they have to face
80, This is a very suave method of doing good for your fellow men indeed an antonym to all bad virtues
80, Altruistic beings are meticulous virtuosos in their good acts of divinity
80,Paragons of Altruism are prevelant among human beings and animals among human beings by donating body organs and blood
80, Among animals altruism is seen amidst meerkats that live in grassland burrows of Africa the senital meerkat stands as a guard of safety while other meerkats are in the burrow he keeps watch over the predator and alarms his fellowmate as soon as he sees the predator arriving towards them for this kind act they either receive a little award or hardly receive anything
80,Such altruistic individuals are even ready to share or give away their food or shelter to their fellow mates without expecting to receive anything in return
80, These beings indeed have a very suave mannerism in all their acts of living
80, They never feel squavished or apprehensive to endanger their life to any extent to save the other
80,Amidst human beings or mammals there are high chances of risking ones life as well in the process of doing for the otherthe senital meerkat stands as an example to this while he alerts his crowd he endangers his own life at first being a shield of defence to his people

81,Problem Set 1: Introductions in EssaysPlease answer these questions in a separate word document and upload the document on the submission link provided outside this lesson
81,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie
81, List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them
81,Format:MOVIE TITLE: Terminator- Judgment Day Dragon Ball Z WHY: Movies are another form of transition world where they take you to an alternate world and make you feel like living in it
81, This can be happened only if the opening sequence of the film is made interesting
81, In Terminator- Judgment day the movie starts off with a dark tone of music where a man comes from the past to the present timeline to fulfill his mission
81, Also in Dragon Ball Z the movie starts of a dream sequence where an enemy who is dead is raised by his soldiers with a high background music which gets followed by the movie title
81, As these concepts where never been approached the audience gets easily involved so was for me as a great memorable opening sequence
81, QUESTION 2:1
81,    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why? Ans) Switzerland is one of the few countries in the world which is rich in culture heritage and wealth
81, It is quite known for “the city of chocolates” and for its ski resorts
81, In my opinion I would like to go to Switzerland on the vacation mainly for skiing and sky diving
81, Additionally I would love to buy and eat the chocolates over there
81,Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
81, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
81, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
81, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
81,Ans) School is a place for both learning and physical activity
81, Children spending time on studying without physical activity would get only knowledge but their body would become lazy
81, To avoid this scenario In my opinion I believe that teachers must give equal importance to both studying and sport activities
81, By this the school day gets limited to short and children can give equal priority to both studying and playing sports
81, Additionally by participating in sport clubs students can benefit schools by winning prizes which internally brings fame to the school

81,Nowadays television has become an excellent communication medium for gathering useful information
81, Especially to know about facts or any truths
81, Professors from different Universities are also appearing on televisions to publish themselves or their respective universities and also give expert commentary on latest events around the world
81, Comparing both the lecture and the passage there are a lot of differences and oppositions
81, Firstly in the passage there are views that the professor is profited and also gets respect among fellow scholars but it is totally opposed in the lecture saying that they are only benefited internally
81, Secondly by appearing on the televisions they will be able to manage the timings of their schedule by losing their important meetings and also not getting enough funds from the university for their research becoming a total disadvantage
81, Thereby while attending the television sets and giving expertise advices to the audience the professors would also need to prepare for the topic travel a lot of distance also have a makeup for the show which all leads to the wastage of the time
81, Therefore even if the professors try to give detailed expertise on their topics the audience need only brief introduction to the topic not the deep lecture
81,In conclusion compared to the lecture and passage the professors on television by contrast get heavily drawbacks and waste a lot of time thinking of self-benefits but internally there are only losses
81,Young People enjoy their life more than old people do…Many of them may think that older people enjoy life more than young people do
81, But according to my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do
81, Younger generation which is often called as youth has more passion and energy which internally is the base for enjoying the life
81, Firstly the younger generation is free from any responsibilities or the tension of work
81, For instance older people have many responsibilities like to take care of their children to complete their work to earn money
81, These responsibilities mainly stop them from enjoying their life
81, Moreover when they try to enjoy their life they prefer their children first
81, All of these factors make them enjoy less compared to the youth
81, On the other hand young people do not have any responsibilities; they are free to choose from variety of options for enjoying their life
81, They can walk out anytime; they can go the most recent movie play anytime etc
81,Additionally young people are more energetic towards anything
81, On the other hand older generation usually go through some disabilities by the time is passing
81, For instance I and my elder brother live in village and usually we try to come together whenever we find some free time
81, And every time we go different places and try new things
81, But during this spring break we want our mom to join us
81, But unfortunately she has knees problem even since she was 45 years old which in course forces us to change our decisions and find some other time to meet
81, Hence we can see that by the time we start to enjoy our life terms will change up to our ages
81,To sum up there is a massive difference between young and older people to enjoy their life
81, But even the older generation can also enjoy their life according to their new age
81, But at some point of the time they feel they are not able to do everything they wanted to and at that time they feel that something is opposing them
81, On the flip side younger people will be able to enjoy life by being more energetic and less responsible

84,Amidst the incomprehensible buzz of the absent minded consumers and the mind numbing advertisements there was just a subtle wave of sweet swift violin emerging from a corner
84, The corner was flooded by impatient people waiting for their turn
84, As the noise grew the corner started attracting more crowd
84, People rushed to the spot trying to reach the corner before any other so that they don’t have to wait longer for their turn
84, All they could see while approaching was a faded top hat of an old tall weather-beaten violinist swinging to and fro with his bow
84, Now he was an old but talented violinist the best of the Reed college jazz band back in the 1980’s
84, The musician was best known for his work “The seasons” which depicted the change through the duration of all the seasons with the beauty of his composition
84, He was often seen in the college campus sometimes trying to depict the twists and turns the leaves take during the fall or the rage and aggression of the storm with his music
84, A popular myth among the college students told “He was the one who bought summer to the campus after the God’s cursed this no land with forever winter
84,” As the crowd grew the violinist slipped into a dream recollecting the artistic beauty of Jazz he experienced during the days he spent with his fellow artists
84, As the crowd impatiently waited eventually the security from the ATM at the corner put out a notice which said “No cash
84,” Slowly the crowd started dissipating with a sense of despair on their faces
84, As the violinist saw this he strung the high minor note on the violin with a sense of ‘lost and found’ of losing the attention but finding peace reminiscing on how things changed
84,
84,Altruism
84, Altruism is an act of selflessness usually seen in mammals living in communities done for the benefit of the community or other individuals and not necessarily for the advantage of the individual doing it
84, Typical altruistic behaviour involves helping the other individuals of community without any return benefits
84, The behaviour study on meerkat’s living in communities found that sometimes one individual called the sentinel moves out of the group and guards the group while they are busy looking for food or while eating
84, In case of emergencies the sentinel would signal it out loud to the group to alert them so that they hide out in the burrows
84, Important thing to notice here is that the meerkat is more prone to be seen by the predator while signalling the group
84, The sentinel risks its life in an act of altruism so that the group can go along with their activities safely
84, Human also tend to perform altruism but not easily at the cost of their lives
84, The normal acts of selflessness we see or do is donating food to the needy helping stranger with some guidance helping neighbours with moving things etc
84,
84, However This theory on Altruism isn’t entirely convincing
84, A recent more closer look at the meerkat sentinels found that the the expected act of selflessness isn’t actually authentic
84, The study found that sentinels are usually closer to their borrows and are the first to escape into safety after signalling
84, Usually this sentinel had already had food
84, So the act of selflessness we thought wasn’t exactly in sacrificing food and risking life
84, Also when we look into ourselves we always look for some reward or for some form of self-worth while performing these acts of altruism
84, Humans tend to suffice themselves with some sense of worth and entitlement while helping out strangers and neighbours in the community
84, Altruism isn’t totally understood for it isn’t clear if its really a selfless behaviour developed along the times of living along with the community or an act driven by self-benefit
84,TASK 2: Freedom from and with Family
84, The world is now driven on freedom of choice and liberty but many a times the liberty is misguiding
84, Children these days are so much conscious about their choices and demand a right to choose among several of their option given by society
84, But we need to understand that some of these choices hurt beyond recovery
84, Having said that it’s also true to say that an individual should have total freedom and responsibility to choose what he lives by
84, May it be the career the work the relationships etc
84,
84,Living with one’s family is always good until there is mutual respect care and love among the family members
84, Living as a family is synonymous to living with and among a group where the state and actions of one member affect the entire group and may have bad consequences on everyone’s living
84,The situation where a person can live in and as a family is ideal this issue
84, Young adults however have the urge of breaking out of the family bond of living and aging with a group under the constraints that the group provides
84, The age urges the individuals to break free and flee
84, However they should also understand that it’s a moral responsibility of a child to take care of his parents when they are no longer capable of supporting themselves either financially of mentally
84,Also separating from the family would reduce the emotional bond between a person and family
84, Living in and along with a family can benefit people in many ways
84, There is always some guidance from the more experienced and the help from the few caring
84, There is always room for making celebrations and sharing sorrow
84,To summarise young adults may leave their families to live separately if they wish but they should have the moral responsibility to care for and protect their families
84, But if the family has no love nd respect to each other it’s not really useful to try and stick together
84,
84,Professors have taken up knowledge sharing through TV appearances and talks
84, However beneficial this may sound there might be bad sides to this initiative too
84,
84, One possible benefit is acquiring reputation among other professors among other universities and also in the general public
84, This not just helps the professor by giving him a wider regard and recognition but the particular academic field and also the particular university will also be benefited
84, The field would then draw funds and the university would gain reputation
84, While this seems as an obvious case there are certain bad effects to this too
84, For example the professors who make frequent TV appearances aren’t considered as serious scholars but rather an entertainer
84, Thus the professor might lose value among the other professors of the community and might also miss-out on the chance to attend important meetings or lectures
84, Also the professor himself might be at risk of losing much of his perks
84, The time spent on preparing the content to be published on tv converting it into the suitable format preparing and rehearsing the content might take-up much of the professors time which can be well spent in the university and on other research
84, Travelling and getting made-up for the TV appearance would also take up a lot of the professor’s valuable time
84,The lecture points out the critical view of the other professors which the passage couldn’t hint
84,Another benefit discussed in the passage is the benefit of the general public from the professors teaching
84, Now from the various TV shows the public can be at much more grip of knowledge at current events and scientific studies
84, But while the public is actually getting benefited there is no point in losing a professors time contributions towards research to the before-bedtime TV shoe
84, The show would just be another briefing on a subject which a reporter can do with proper background work

84, They might have to face failures live up to expectations and the competitive environment set-up career plan and proceed accordingly etc
84,
84, While the person is busy doing all these s/he would definitely miss out on enjoying
84, This can be argued by saying that the work we do should be enjoyable
84, That’s not the case with many young people
84, Many youngsters study and work in fields that they are not interested in because of lack of affordability and lack of chances
84, The happiness index of any country depends mostly on the youngsters because they are the greater proportion
84, Many a times the countries where the affordability relative chances of study and work for youngsters employability etc are the major factors
84, The countries which are not developed or are still developing show low happiness indices
84, This clearly states that the major proportion of the population of the country mostly youngsters is not happy
84,Also in a lighter sense older people have more freedom of living
84, Older people are economically stable and have the choice of living life their own way
84, While youngsters have to be bound by their goals and career perspectives older people can choose to work and live as they wish
84, When it comes to living happily older people can get away to happiness faster as they have much more experience
84, While youngsters are still figuring out what choice to be made the older people have already made the choices
84, They might not have the energy but they have wisdom
84, Ultimately happy living is all in how a person makes his living
84, But in a practical and broader perspective its not necessarily that young people enjoy more than the older people or the other way around

87,WRITING TASK -1 The topic in the passage is about the professors appearance in the television
87, I agree with it and it was good because making the professors interact with the television audience will educate the public
87, The purpose of the appearance and the effect should also be noticed
87, The professors will observe many and different students in the Universities and colleges
87, So it will help him/her to interact with the budding Graduate students and will help them to know how to be a productive student
87, It will also help the graduate students to know the needs of the society which will improvise his/her role in the society
87, On the other side some of the professors will make their appearance in the television only for entertainment
87, The sort of appearances mentioned in the above line doesn’t have any use for the society and there will be waste in lot of time
87,Moreover the television appearances which are useful for the society will increase the reputation of the professor as well as the college/ University in which he is working

87,In the young age everybody wants to enjoy rather than being focused on the goals
87, They will always want to enjoy the life in the way they want to
87, In the process the young minds also have the fresh and creative thoughts to enjoy the life
87, The way they want to be makes them more excited and make them enjoy in the life
87, The older people have spent all their age and at that age they will feel more relaxed than in the excitement to enjoy their remaining life
87, Some of the people may regret their past actions in the young or middle age and they want to enjoy the remaining life
87, Even though some of them want to enjoy their remaining life they don’t have the energy in the young age
87, Many constraints like lack of physical strength and adaptability to the extremities will come into play and make them to end up in cancelling the plans
87, Whereas in the young age people will find the time to enjoy with the friends and colleagues as the responsibilities are less compared to other age people
87,I support my point by mentioning an example below
87, Let us consider a picnic with all groups of people
87, In them the young people find the different places because of keen to explore the things make them to make maximum memories
87, Moreover the past memories of the young people are less compared to the old people and even the little things and incidents which make them laugh and excite make them more enjoyed and thrilled

87, On the warning sign all the members of the group will seek shelter and hide themselves

87,But coming to some of the studies show that in the mammal species meerkats though the sentinel acts the guard it guards with the full stomach

87,When I was trolling some career websites this week I noticed that your company has a trot out for an intern this summer the position sounds good
87, Can you email me back and tell me what’s up with the application process?
88,Young people enjoy life more than older people do
88,No I do not agree with the above statement
88, Older people do enjoy life as much as young people
88, In fact in the present day it can be seen that old people are happier than young people
88, Most of the younger generation these days think that enjoying life means being rich or getting rich
88, But I feel that it’s not money or other superficial things that make our life enjoyable rather it is love and family that makes life more fun and enjoyable
88, And for old people family is their life and love
88, Young couples these days hardly spend time together they are more money driven having no time for love and family
88, They might superficially enjoy once in a week or a month or a year but that’s not what actual enjoyment means
88,Older people may not be physically fit enough to enjoy the superficial things but they are fit enough mentally to enjoy the real life
88, A survey was conducted by the WHO in Singapore in 20012
88, This involved asking people to what extent they think that they enjoy life
88, And surprisingly the survey results showed that almost 70 percent of the people who are happy and are enjoying their life are aged above 60
88, I don’t think it is important that one should be young to enjoy life until unless one stops enjoying life to full extent he/she is young
88, Age should just be a number only then one can possibly enjoy life till the very end
88, Of course there are young people who truly enjoy life and they should be the prime example for us to learn the true meaning of enjoyment
88, The passage makes us see through the view point that professors appearing on TV has benefit to public as well as professors themselves
88, The lecturer in the lecture has a quite opposite opinion
88, According to the lecturer when a professor appears on TV his/her reputation among the professors group is decreased because they feel the professor is rather entertaining than educating
88, Whereas in the passage it was said that appearing on TV makes professors acquire reputations in their academic fields among much wider audience than they have in university
88,According to the passage when a professor appears on TV thousands of people outside the narrow academic community become aware of the professor’s ideas
88, Contrary to this the lecturer points that when professors appear on television their availability for students of university is decreased this leads to decrease of the professor’s importance in the university
88, This may lead to situation where that professor is not invited for conferences or may not even get help for his research
88,The passage points out that when professors appear on TV the reputation of their universities is increased
88, People start to think highly of those universities which leads to increase in donations and application from potential students
88,To the end the passage points out that TV programs are usually superficial and are not deep and thoughtful but when a professor appears on TV to share his ideas viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight
88, On the contrary the lecturer says that TV broadcasting channels are not concerned with the depth of topics but are more interested in overview which can be presented even by a reporter who has done his homework

88,This was he was able to help a number of students achieve their dreams for 10 years
88,
88,The idea of altruism is fantastically explained in the passage
88,The lecture highlighted about the behaviour of meerkats that contradicts the information given in the passage
88,In the passage it was said that a guarding meerkat goes without food while others eat whilst accordig to the lecture the guarding meerkats are the ones that eat ahead of other meerkats
88,Another point where the lecture contradicts passage is- It was given in the passage that when a guarding meerkat issues an alarmit sholud flee alone but the survey mentioned in the lecture tells us that the guarding meerkats go into the burrows immediately after issuing alarmwhile putting the rest of the group in greater danger
88,Coming to humans altruism is not very common but there are cases of such behaviour in everyone's life
88,For example when a person donates an organ(like kidney as mentioned in the lecture) to a relative it depicts the altruistic nature of that person
88,But the lecture questions us that even for such altruism there's a non-material reward like increased self value
88,The term 'Freedom' is one of the important things in our life
88,In my opinion the situation where adults live with their families for longer is better
88,One shouldn't misunderstand 'freedom' as 'staying away from family or '
88,It's is really important for a young adult to understand these two things
88, You can enjpy the freedom even while you saty with your family but that kind of freedom isn't guarenteed if you choose to be independent
88,When we live with our familly it guides you in every aspect of life say it education or career development or anything family always stay by our side and guides us to the goal
88,There was a survey in USA where it was assesed whether adults staying independent of their family or the ones with their family were more successful
88,To surprise it was found that most of them prefered to stay indepndent but the ones who were with their families were far more successful than others
88,Infact it was found that the later category enjoyed a greater range of freedom than the prior ones
88,From the viewpoint of families it's important to stay together parents help their younger ones to overcome the obstacles that were experienced by them
88,Staying with family is like staying with a guide for life which teaches us and makes us learn the lessons of life effectively
88,And more importantly in our younger adult age most of are tempted to choose the wrong path in life and ruin the this wonderful gift we get
88, The possibility of such error is greatly reduced when we stay with our family
88,At the same time we need our space that's true! So parents should also be considerate about our freedom
88, Staying independent of family may give us that space but it doesn't give us the right freedominfact that's shouldn't be called freedom
88,"So I would like to conclude by saying asking that ""Do we really need to be independent of our parents or family? after all they are make our life right?"""

89, And for her a legend will bounce off from the mountain is what makes the audience puzzled at the first scene
89, The sound effects and the picture effects which were added behind the scenes were so splendid
89, MOVIE TITLE: Beauty and the BeastWHY: It is a traditional fairy tale which begins with a narrator describing the story of a young price who lived in a shining castle and how he transformed into a hideous beast

89,Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day
89, Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices
89, Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students
89, In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer
89,THINK AGAIN!! About the discussion for implementing a longer school day I oppose it because the students also need to concentrate equally on sport practices and other extracurricular activities

89, In fact some student may get really exhausted spending their whole day in school

9,Writing Task 1:Altruism is an unselfishness behaviour among animals which means sacrificing for other animals and gaining nothing for themselves
9,Sharing of food and donation of human body organs are the examples for Altruism
9,Animals sacrifice food and even their life in order to assist their member group and best example among them is Meerkat
9,When Meerkats move in groups for hunting food an individual Meerkat acts as a Sentinel to protect them from the predators
9,Whenever a Sentinel Meerkat sees predators it starts alarming thus alerting other Meerkat groups to run away or seek shelter
9,By standing guard Meerkat makes its life more risk to a predator
9,Thus altruistic behaviour makes the survival of other animal groups
9,Writing Task-2Now-days most of the people are willing to have nuclear families which make the younger generations to impart the same from their parents
9, Independence is required in every case of an individual but that should limit to some extent
9, So according to me it is best for the young adult to be as a part of his or her family for the following reasons
9, Firstly a young adult will be under the supervision of his/her parents so that there will be no deviation of his mind on to the negative things which will make his career ruin
9, For Example if a teenager comes out of his family he will soon get addicted to the posh immaterial things and if he is not in a position to earn for himself he then starts earning in a wrong way which means that losing his own character for stupid things
9, Secondly living with parents for a longer time makes a young adult to build his/her morals of life and finally tuning himself/herself into a good individual to his/her family and also to the society
9, For example when there is a bad situation in one’s family the head of the family takes responsibility in handling the situation and tries to figure out the least possible case to come out of it and to lead as usual life 
9,This is a case that makes a teenager learn from his parents on handling these kind of situations and try build his character
9, In conclusion a teenager should have enough thinking levels on what he is expecting and should go on with his family relationship for a longer time to prove himself a great characterized person
9,
9,Task-1:Professors who appear on TV do not fall into a category of professional stand which means that they are not serious Scholars
9,In addition to this they only fall into an entertainment category as per the lecture is concerned
9,On the contrast professors benefit from appearing on TV because they get much publicity which in turn increases the University Standards as if the reputed person is from the specific university and this result in increase of donations for an university
9,On the other hand the professor is given much importance because of the following reasons: 1) takes lot of time for rehearsals before giving a lecture on TV
9, 2) Time spent on His appearance 
9,3) Explaining doubts and meeting Students
9,Next to this when professors get reputed then one of the major problems faced by them will be that they do not come to university campus and usually appear more on TV
9, But this may be helpful to other students outside the university but not to the students within the campus levels
9, Finally the above are few points that oppose the given paragraph
9, Task-2:Topic: Young people enjoy life more than older people do
9,Generally young people have more options and many choices for their enjoyment as old people do not
9, But in my opinion I equally support for young people and also to older people because of the following reasons:Firstly not only in this trending environment but also when take the past generations young people enjoy at most times as if there are not given any responsibilities as that of the older people have
9, For Example young people like teenagers go to college just by doing their work that is assigned by their teachers where as the older people have may responsibilities like cooking looking after their younger ones for all needs helping them whenever they are in need and many things to go on
9,Secondly young people make some adventures and they do not care for anything as if they have no responsibilities
9, They sometime go out for tours with their school mates and college mates and have lots of free time to do their work whereas the older ones always care for their children and do not risk their life for making adventures
9,On the other hand older people also enjoy their life by spending time with the people of same age and in addition to this they even plan tours along with their families to long distances which makes a strong bonding with in their relationships
9, Next to it few of the older people also enjoy their life in attending spiritual classes and also listen to all such related topics which usually come in Television channels 
9,Also they plan for some pilgrim centres with same age groups and that makes them even happier when they get bored of the routine life
9,In a nut shell there are equal options for the young ones and also for the older ones to enjoy one own life at the extreme

90,"SOFT SKILLSWRITING:1)In this lecture we had the topic named ""Altruism"" "
90,Altruism is the a behaviour which generally observed in humans and it is rarely observed in animals
90, In the audio lecture we had heard about the meerkats behaviour
90, From this we can observe the mode altruism is the a rare behaviour which is opposite to selfish behaviour
90,Altruism is observed in humans when we meet a unknown stranger like by offering food saying information required and guiding or help for any reason and some of the humans donate their organs and necessities with of any greediness
90, This sought of behaviour is called altruism
90,Author also mentions about sentinel meerkats who stand for the group and observes the predators and makes an alarm signal to the groups to escape without having any food and shelter all the time and many sentinel meerkats lost their life for sake of their groups and families 
90,Sentinel meerkat : it goes without food while others eat and it places itself in grave danger After it issues an alarm it has to flee alonewhich might take it more risk to a predator since animals in grouos are often able to work together to fend off a predator
90,2)From the moment a person born struggle for the independence and fight for the independence For example in the childhood at the age of months and years baby tries to escape from the parents and struggles for standing and support and likely to move independently without any support

90, Their independence depends on certain conditions 
90,if they met their conditions then the decision will be onside
90, Up to certain age every person should be under the control of the guardians or parents For example a child of ten years cries for an unwanted thing parents must take care and keenly manage the situation and gift them with a thing useful for them 
90,Most parents does the same
90,Independence is needed to every individual after the maturity age or else after completing the studies or when he enters into the profession
90,If the adults who are not enough lnowledge about the people around him isn’t allowed to leave independently as of he isn’t having enough knowledge

90,When I was trolling few career websites this week I noticed that your company has a tout out for an intern this summer
90, The position sounds rad
90, Can you send me an email and tell me regarding the application process?
90,Everyone in the world wants to enjoy in their life as much as possible
90, Every individual has its own way of enjoying the life
90, In general young people have more chances of enjoyment than that of older people
90, This is mostly due to the reason older people have lesser life time when compared with younger ones
90,As Young people have more energy they can do things easily that is not possible for older people
90, The zeal and the huge energy in the young people makes them more enjoy than that of older people
90, As younger people have less health issues when compared to the older ones which makes time for them to enjoy more
90, Some sports like tracking racing and other challenging games can be easily performed by youngsters than compared to older
90, Older people cannot take part in these kinds of enjoyment due to risk to health
90, As a result due to more chances of enjoyment younger tend to enjoy life more than older people
90, Moreover as teenagers have more opportunities of doing things they like to do whenever and whatever this makes their life more enjoyable
90, The young energy helps them in achieving the success in all the tasks they like to do and they can build their professional career easily
90, But an older person who has passed the desired age-limit will be not be eligible for the same opportunity due to his age
90, As more opportunities are available for young people they enjoy their life more
90,Anyways even older people enjoy their life but in their own way
90, Having gone through all the experiences and the situations of life usually older generation desire for relaxation peaceful and a slow-paced life
90, They usually enjoy being at home with their family
90, In modern world tech enjoyment involving speed and attention does give up their reality real nature enjoyment
90, By spending time with their family gives them most enjoyment
90,But the diversity of enjoyable things gives young people more chances to enjoy life compared to older people
90,
90,The lecture in the listening section and the passage in the reading section talks about the university professors and their appearances in public
90, The reading section conveys that the professors’ appearance is useful for both public and university
90, The lecture contradicts the information that is present in reading section
90, The reading states that the professors themselves get benefited by appearing on television as they gain reputation to a larger scale among the general public
90, The lecture however states that such appearances were not good for the development of professional careersNext the reading passage makes the point that universities can gain and benefit from these appearances as well and the universities will gain the reputation by those professors which will increase the market of the university in the public
90, The lecture ignores it by saying that the professor is wasting his time by spending in television instead he could spend time with students or by doing research will works fine for him
90,In conclusion the reading conveys that the public can learn from these television shows of professors and that they can gain the ability to understand things that they never knew about before or taught before
90, On the other hand the lecture concludes this argument by saying that the television shows do not invite professors to talk about the deep knowledge they have as this was not their aim
90, They invite them to talk about the general issues and their main aim is to attract the public by the title of the professor and not by his knowledge or designation
90,
91,Altruism is actually a behavior of sacrificing its own things to others
91, According to the passage animals sacrifices things to others 
91,for example meerkats the individual acts as sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators where other in hunt for food and some other to obtain food
91, By standing guard the sentinel meerkat don’t get anything
91, It goes without food while the others eat and places itself in danger And humans are also helpful to others
91, Even if they don’t know other person they are helpful to others starting from the small things like sharing food to big helps like donating body organs etc
91,
91, According to the audio humans and species both are altruistic 
91,Species helps to other species and human are also
91, Humans donate kidneys even though they don’t the other person 
91, Now a days some of the adults like to live with their parents and some other want independence
91,According to me the opinion depends on the mentality of that person
91, Living with the parents is better because that is the age where most of the people may take wrong step and do wrong things
91, If we go in a wrong way parents are there to explain us about things which are wrong wrong 
91, In todays generation adults are doing wrong things (not all the youngsters but some)eventhough Parents are taking more intrest towards their children
91,They are habituated to ciggerattes and drinks 
91, For example in nirbaya case the people who did the thing are from worst background and they all are of rowdies type
91, If those people are under the guidance of their parents they may didn’t do that things
91,Because parents will observe the every step of their child and they protect their child
91, The main thing isnow a days children are staying in hostels from 10-15 years age only
91,They are habituated to that and are not willing to stay with their parents that is the main reason 
91,and one more thing is forgein culture 
91,Following forgein culture is became a fashion for todays generation people
91,That is not good all the time
91,We should know every thing but have to do the write thingsthat is possible only if when parents and children will live together
91, Parents don’t know what their children are doing until parents and children will live together 
91,So they can know what their children doing And stop them from wrong things
91, Writing TaskPassage mentioned positive points on professors giving lectures in TV
91, It is clear that audio was quite opposite to that view
91,As a coin has two sides Every things leads to positive and negative
91, Passage mentioned positive impacts on college college students and professors and the people 
91, And Audio mentioned negative impact on the college students and on the college
91, According to Passage By TV shows college and professors reputation will increase and also people who was watching TV also will get knowledge on that particular topic
91,As journals and news paper articles by the professors are maximum read by only other professors and not all the people professors will get more response on TV shows rather than publishing their journals or any other newspaper content
91, And By seeing a professor with a highly knowledge people will have high expectations to that college
91, So that the college and professors reputation increases
91,But according to the audio It can have negative impact on the college and college students
91, Because of TV shows professor’s time might become waste
91, (Show time preparation time travelling time etc
91,
91,)
91,So he/she may spent on that things in college hours
91, That is may loss to the students and college reputation
91,

92,1Altruism is considered to be an act of mere kindness or opposite to selfishness
92, Altruism is more commonly found in the clan of animal kinds rather than humans
92,According to the lecture the recent surveys show that animals which act as Sentinels of their group enjoy more facilities like eating food before the othe rmembers of the group etc
92,Well apparently it has been proven that sentinel guard which sees the predators first gives out an alarming cry to alert the other members of the group
92, This infact helps the predator to focus on the group rather than one since the alarming cry by the sentinel makes the group to either gather at a point or move away towards the safety
92, This gives the sentinel more chances of saving his life
92,Even though Sentinels are brave enough to do such risky tasks it has to be ensured that they attain the importance of their valuable deeds
92,Similarly when compared with the altruistic nature of humans it doesn't depend upon the amount of the work done or the importance of deed it all depends upon the unselfish nature of the society to act altruistic similar to the meerkat
92,"""INDEPENDENCE FROM FAMILY DOESN'T MAKE YOU STRONG IT MAKES YOU FEEL NOSTALGIC""Firstly it all depends on the attitude of the people living with their parents"
92, Eventhough we consider ourselves to be a westernising/modernising country it isn't necessary to leave the parents and leave an independent life
92, The culture of Nuclear families is gaining popularity in our country because of ennumerate reasons depending on the class people belong to in the society
92, Enthusiastic youth tend to leave their parents as young adults to pursue their passion in the form of career
92, But they do forget the fact that their parents always care for them
92,Leaving your parents as a tender youth is a complete misconception among the people living in the present society
92, Nevertheless there arises a question did they leave you when you were young?! Most of the cases it's absolutely 'No'
92, Prominent celebrities like Virat Kohli started oldage homes to ensure the protection and service of the old who are left stranded by their children
92,Actually staying with parents for a longer period of time makes one happy and feel secured
92, They get the feeling of surity while discussing personal as well as social grievances with the close ones like parents

93,As the generations are changing the mentality of the people is also gaining a drastic change
93, Now- a- days most of the young generation want to be more independent by standing on their own capability in this world
93, The youth want to be independent and want to gain the knowledge about the society with their own interest
93, They want to get away from their parents exploring the world all by themselves
93, This is a right way to get self capable and also to improve the self confidence
93, They will understand the world better by being independent rather than being with their parents as they may have viewed it in a different manner
93, However being away from parents may lead to certain loss as values and morals but they can be capable of making new relationships
93, Moreover they can understand the depth of the relationship concept by being away from their parents love
93, Every day they learn new things
93, The youth who prefer to be with the parents may not get a chance to view world better because they have influence of their parents on their mind and their way of thinking
93, By being independent they can have a lot more interaction with the social communities rather being with the parents
93, However being away from family is also not good leaving their parents alone but to gain more knowledge one should see the world in his own perspective
93, Hence in my view being independent is more useful to the youth to get into a new world and can have a freedom to understand and explore the things by their own and developing their capabilities

93,The lecture and the passage was about professors on television
93, In the passage it is given that it is of great benefit to the professors as well as the universities and also to the general public
93, In contrast in the lecture it is said that it is not at all benefit to any one and it is of time waste
93, In the passage it is given that by appearing on television could acquire reputations among a much wider audience which also enhances professors as scholars
93, But in the lecture it is said that it is not a professional standard
93, By being on television no one will become a scholar
93, In the passage it is given that the universities will also benefit when the professors appear on television they think that when a expert professor appear on Television the people who are seeing will think high about that university
93, On the other hand in the lecture it is mentioned that the main goal of a professor should be to educate the students
93, At last in the passage it is mentioned that public will gain from the professors being on the television as they don’t have direct contacts with any of the professor but in this way they can learn from experts but in contrast in the lecture it is said that the academic title is not intellectual substance

93, The caretaker of that orphanage was of bad attitude she used to treat children as slaves and they used to get food only if they bring some money after selling the Match sticks they have made
93, It was sometime in December the little girl was selling the matchsticks she brought with her
93, She was hungry and her mouth waters seeing food around her
93, She tried hard and still there are some matchsticks left in her basket
93, It was late at night moreover it was December there is full of snow falling and it was too cold
93, She stopped selling her matchsticks and headed back to the Orphanage
93, She was walking along the roadside and she saw a happy family sitting together and having their dinner
93, She felt bad and she was upset she felt like crying by reminiscing on how things have changed
93, The weather was too cold that the little girl can’t bear
93, She saw a place with a roof and sat there
93,As it was too cold she wants to use a Matchstick to feel the warm but she is left with only six matchsticks

93, Then to continue that she used fifth and sixth stick together and felt like her mother took her into her arms and making her sleep
93,Now the six sticks are over but the girl neither woke up nor felt the cold it is not because that she was in her dream of her mother
93, A death has occurred there at that midnight of the little girl who let her soul reach her mother’s after life

93,The young people enjoy life more than the older people do Yes i completely agree with the statement

95,Task-IIThe phrase Enjoying Life is quite a common word we use it in our daily life but when it comes to implementation there are lot of variations about how a man can enjoy his life
95, When it comes to enjoying in different periods of your life it is controversial
95, According to my view people at any age can enjoy their life but it depends on their personal parameters young people have time to plan their day where as older people have various responsibilities
95, Since young people have time they can spend their time in their hobbies partying and other stuff where they can find fun
95, Young people have good control over their health which enhances their efficiency which turns out to be a active person where older people should take care of their health and look after their children this creates the major difference between young and old people
95, Young people have a very few or little stress out of their mind which makes them live more stress free which in turn leads to enjoyment than people at greater age who has more stress
95, On the other side there is a wide counter talk that older people can enjoy more a young man can do
95, This is because of many reasons stated below
95, Young people are in state or in their way to achieve something in life if they concentrate more on enjoying rather than their career it main spoil his/her life but a older man is ready to enjoy as he as all set with his career
95, It’s the responsibility of the young people to satisfy their parents teachers and should achieve something in that case it is the older generation who has no tensions and can live life peacefully So it is always controversial to judge who can enjoy more

96,We generally see the professors in the college
96, In addition to that we may see them in office library news papers and also in telivision
96, Sometimes these television appearences have benifits for professor Universities and also public
96,The passage is regarding reasons why professors appear on teelevision
96, for reputation of the professor and college and to educate the public
96,But the passage also says about disadvantages As some professors regularly appear in the TV they may not it much seriously
96, And also the time of the professor will be wasted interms of giving lecture and making it ready (reharsal )
96,We are not sure that because of this the professor is getting benifited or not
96, Because there is a chance of getting neggetive impression for the professor

96,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We can say that Young people enjoy life
96, But we cannot compare young people and old people in enjoyment
96, According to me the enjoment would be with respect to the person not the age
96, If we are not happy even if it is young or old does not matter
96,However sometimes we can say young people enjoys a lot because they have the energy to do so
96, For Example If we discuss related to sports both young and old can watch a football match
96, But young people enjoy more by playing like the players where as old people doesn't have that much stamina to play
96, In addition to that young people can travel more distance than old people Because as we said old people have less energy
96, For example If we want to go for the world tour young people can travel more and cover many places compared to old people
96, Finally there is no kind of differentiating between old people and young people It all depends on there own enjoyment

97, It is my pleasure to work here in this most famous organization
97, I would like to be part of the development of this company
97, So I am writing you to put forward my new idea to be used in the upcoming project
97, Idea: Gaming and animation are excellent entertainment sources for kids
97, So if we develop the next project with 3D effects and sensor moves there will be growth in our market
97, To implement this idea I would like to have a technical team with 4 members

97,Technician to add sensor activities

97, Favourite introductory scenesEvery one of us might have heard of a famous phrase “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover
97,” The idiom says that one cannot judge anything without going through it totally
97, But in some situations especially in movies and special programs first look and curtain raisers like teasers trailers have much effect on audience
97, Sometimes these become the deciding factors of movies to get hit or flop
97, I heard somewhere that “Every journey starts with a good step
97,” This totally applies in case of movie making
97, The opening scene of a movie can change the essence of the entire movie
97, The first scene of a movie drags the attention of audience and creates more interest
97, I would like to explain the most memorable opening scenes I have seen in movies
97, SHIVAY: I recently watched the movie “Shivay” and the first scene of the movie was awesome
97, The leading actor Ajay Devgan was a Himalayan mountaineer in the movie
97, The opening scene was a sad moment and it created suspense and curiosity in every one
97, Then the next scene starts with flash back
97, In the next scene he climbed the Everest very easily and intensity of that scene was so nice
97, His acting was very natural
97, Everyone will like that scene
97, In fact the movie was little boring and the story line was too short
97, But scenes like this created interest in us
97, This definitely helps the movie to get good talk
97,HARRY POTTER: Another movie I like most is Harry potter movie series in which the opening scenes are very interesting and mysterious in all the parts
97,So these are the movie scenes I liked and can say that a great introduction makes any thing much better
97,Opinion on implementing longer school dayIf I am one of the teachers of a school board and need to give suggestion about the proposal of implementing a longer school day I will stand against it
97, These days’ kids are already facing many problems because of our education system and it affects their future
97, Our education system needs to change a lot
97,I would suggest not to implement longer school day as it will affect their sport practices
97, Children have to play sports and games daily to develop physically and mentally
97, They want some refreshment from studies which they do the whole day
97,If the school day is extended again for some more time they will lose interest and get bored instead of spending more time on studies
97, Then there will be no use of implementing the idea of longer school day
97,Teachers can see better results if this time is allocated to practice more sports and for fun activities among students than planning to implement the time for more studies
97,So my opinion is not to implement the idea of extending the school day for studies and I would try to convince the members of the school board to change their idea in this way

97, It will be very helpful for your team if you learn this
97, Another point I would like to mention is that you should improve presentation skills which I heard from or clients
97, This might have negative effect on your career unless you improve your skills
97, The main thing I did not mention yet is your lack of assertiveness
97, This may become a big barrier for development of your career

97, There are many reasons to support this statement
97, Every one of us definitely have lot of experiences in our life to think of the meaning behind this statement
97, This bring a different energy in us
97,Usually young people are known to be careless reckless and not serious about their lives
97, People think that they just enjoy life and do not think about any thing else
97, But actually to say this kind of thinking is wrong
97, Young people have ore knowledge about our society and surroundings than older people
97, Older people only think of their generation and do not understand the circumstances and problems of younger people from their end
97, This leads to conflicts between the two generations
97, Only few parents understand the situations of their children from their aspect
97,So I can definitely say that young people enjoy more because they do not have any responsibilities financial problems family problems and any other hard situations
97, Even though some younger ones have such kind of problems they can face them bravely and move forward in their lives
97,And the main reason that older people can not enjoy life as much as young people do is that they will become exhausted weighing all the responsibilities being parents guardians of their family members
97, And one more thing is that their age has already been gone to enjoy life any more
97,The basic and most important reason behind the statement given is that STUDENT life is the most lovable time in every one’s dairy to enjoy their life
97, This is the main cause that affect our life enormously from all corners
97, Being a student can enjoy life in peaks than any other person can do who may be an older one or younger

97,TV Professors vs University ProfessorsFrom to the lecture being television professors is not much advantageous
97, From the passage it was clear that University professors may get fame and reputation if they appear in TV
97, Only few professors get chance to appear in TV and a few utilise their chance
97,Along with the benefits of being not only a University professor but also TV professor there are some disadvantages too according to the lecture
97, The main disadvantages are:University professors are not much invited as television professors as university professors are different from TV professors
97, Because TV professors are known for not only for bringing awareness among people from their lectures but also they entertain the viewers
97, This can not be done by the University professors as not that entertaining
97, So the job as a TV professor does not suits them
97,Professors being TV profesors may not be invited for some good scholastic meetings and programs as they do not appear serious when appear in television
97,Another disadvantage is that University professors mostly need to do research and give lectures to their students
97,Also professors who appear in television hardly have time to prepare materials and other required documents necessary for research
97, And they could not complete even the basic needed works in their personal life because of working for extra hours

97, I have been waiting for this
97, I really have an interesting secret needs to be confessed to someone else but could not do it as no one believes it for sure
97, This is my secret
97,It was my first day as a college student and everything was nice there
97, As I am a book lover I visited our college library and went through almost all genres
97, There I found a book about an alien from outer space and stopped there
97, From the next day I started to read that book daily for some time without fail
97, I totally addicted to the stories on aliens and read all facts about them
97, I was becoming curious day by day and decided to find the truth about aliens in real
97,One fine day late at night I went to a place about which I have read in the books to look for any clues
97, The place was near a forest which is 40KM from my home and need to cross that forest to reach that spot
97, I was scared to go into forest alone first but mustered my courage and continued my journey
97, I almost reached the other end of the forest then suddenly there was a big noise and a very bright light that I couldn’t even open my eyes 
97,After few seconds I tried to open my eyes and got astonished at the next moment
97,I found a group of some strange creatures in a big spaceship when the spaceship was about to start
97, In a flash the spaceship disappeared with those aliens
97, I was literally fainted and fortunately reached home safely at last

97,Passage 1: ALTRUISMAltruism is a kind of behaviour which is quite opposite of selfishness
97, The animal which is best example for altruism quality is Meerkat
97, From passage meerkats are mammals that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa
97, They look for predators standing like a guard and acts as sentinels
97,But from the lecturethe important point is that the standing guard in Meerkat eat more and stands as sentinel with full of stomach while the others hunt food when one Meerkat acts as a sentinel
97, And anothe thing about Meerkats is that they are naturally generous
97, One Meerkat is to be taken as a sentinel and it should protect other Meerkats
97,And these mammals performing altrustic acts gain nothing according to the passage
97, The lecture is about altrustic acts of Meerkats says that the Meerkats which acts as a sentinel gain respect and other profits from their group
97, They concentrate on predators which may approach their group and do harmso they give a signal to their members and issues alarm
97,So this sentinel behaviour of altruistic acts helps the survival of whole group of Meerkat mammals
97,2
97,SITUATIONS:YOUNG ADULTS WANT INDEPENDENCE AND SOME WANT TO LIVE WITH PARENTSI support both situations as they depend on the mentality and mindset of the members of a family
97, Young adults may want freedom from parents but it is wrong saying that it is independence from their parents
97, As an independent individual every young person should develop his/her life skills
97,Depending on parents their whole life is a disgusting thing
97,The other situation is that some young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer timethat is their kind hearted nature to care for their parents
97,On the other hand some young people want to stay with their parents just to spend the earnings of their parents and spends life unless working hard
97,This is very opposing thing that those young people should mature their minds
97,That is why I prefer people's character and not situations
97,So the situations given depends not only on young ones but also on parents
97, But in normal case in my opinion being independent is an good thing
97, So i prefer first situation of getting independence from parents 
97,It does not mean that leaving parents for ever and don not show caring for them 
97,If we get independence we can achieve our goals by our own and make our parents feel proud
97, If they forget their parents after they got settled and left parents with out any concern is a bad thing that i do not support ever
97, But when young adults want to get independence as soon as possible is not a bad thing
97, Every thing in this world is connected to other situations and all are inter connected
97, One can not judge other person with out having any idea
97,So i feel that the first situation is better one and that does not mean that the second situation is bad
97,It may seem to be in a diplomatic way but according to me the situations are depended and interconnected

98,Sources for College Writing Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments
98, (1) First they can draw on personal experiences
98, (2) For example for an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or she communicates through conversations with others while at work or at home
98, (3) In addition a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with others electronically via email or texting or Facebook
98, Students might (4) also find examples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previous writing assignments
98, (5) Second student writers can look for ideas from other people’s experiences
98, (6) for instance writers can interview other students or even family members
98, (7) Additionally a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class
98, (8) For one thing source would be television shows on the topic of communication
98, (9) All in all college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment
98, (10) On the whole lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills
98, (11) As one can see a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; (12) Moreover reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases
98, (13) Finally college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments

98,Q)  If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?A) If I want to go on vacation anywhere in the world I wish to choose VATICAN CITY the city with low population and with low pollution
98, The total area of that city is approximately 44 hectares with population of 842
98, More than half of the city is covered with gardens which provide ecofriendly to nature
98, The city observes a variety of climatic conditions so that we can feel pleasant and comfortable
98, Buildings such as St
98, peter`s basilica and the Sistine Chapel are home to some of the most famous art in the world which includes works by artists such as Botticelli Bernini and Michelangelo
98, The Vatican Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical scientific and cultural importance
98, In 1984 the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire country
98,Schools days should be longer or shorter is a controvencial concept
98, According to the school board the view of increasing amount of hours may lead to the more education for the students
98, But it is not real in the holistic perceptive
98, The view of school board is to increase the gradesbut unknowingly the converse of this may happen as per many reports which was stated by National school Boards for public education which states : “Decrease in time would be for the best interest of education”
98, In our modern world of education the average student ranging from all grades and ages go through a school day of 7-8 hrs
98, Although these hours are thought to be such a short period of time they are the major cause for high stress within teens as well as loss of value education and sleep which may lead to deterioration of education
98, “Today`s children are tomorrow`s citizens” can be achieved through only effortless and value based education but not with a regressive approach of learning
98,
98,Writing based on Reading and listeningThe key points made in lecture are:Whether any one being beneficed?Missing invitations for university academics?Lack of money for research?Waste of time?As it is mentioned in the passage that the universities students professors and society are benefited from the guest appearance of professor in TV
98, But it is fact that no one is going to be benefited from that
98,Because when any professor goes for TV appearance it will be a main problem for both universities and students
98, For the university management it is difficult to maintain extra staff and for students it results in lack of explanation process
98,When any professor goes for a TV appearance there will be more chances for him to miss the invitations to give any journals
98, But in passage it is mentioned that “professors are important as scholar is enhanced
98,When any professor goes as TV guest lecturer he /she may miss money to perform any research as the university is going to sponsor for the lectures those are available in university
98, This ends for lecturer in investing own money for research
98,It will be waste of time as lecturer has to come from another place
98, This results in waste of travelling time preparation time and others
98,These are the key points that are discussed in lecture
98,
98,Young people enjoy life more than old people do?Every person`s life is divided into four major categories
98, They are:Childhood Teenage(young age)Middle ageOld age In every category each individual has some limitations
98, In childhood limitations are being kept by parents and in middle age we ourselves keep limitations for our children`s sake
98, The remaining two periods are left to our decisions and our choices
98, During young age we think there is no one who will stop us but during old age there will be no one to stand with us
98,The most important and precious part in everyone`s life is teenage (young age)
98, We will eat the fruit in future from the tree that we planted in young age
98, In my point of view young people enjoy life more than old people do
98, Because during young age everyone will think only for their sake and there will be no limits for them
98, I believe that “Today`s old people are also young people in past of their life and also they enjoyed their life”
98, At certain period these young people will become old and they cannot enjoy at that time
98,So we should enjoy when we are young
98, There will be a large number of ways for young people to enjoy but for the old the enjoyment lies in seeing their grandchildren
98, Some will enjoy by playing games and sports
98, Some will enjoy by watching movies and going to several places
98, But we cannot say that young people have to enjoy all the time
98, There should be some limit for the enjoyment also
98, The young people should plan or make their way so perfectly to have a bright future along with enjoyment
98, For example if we consider a family grandparents will not enjoy as much as their grandchild enjoys
98, So I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people do and I want to add one more point that the output of enjoyment must be a good one
98,
98,MOVIE TITLE: GENTLEMAN (2016)WHY: The introduction scene of this movie is the best introduction scene I had ever seen
98, This movie begins with a scenario in which the two heroines are sitting side by side in a flight
98, After some time they introduce themselves to one another and they describe their love story to each other
98, The director raises curiosity in viewers by visualizing the same person as their lover
98, The rest of the story deals with how they settled in their respective fields
98, MOVIE TITLE: Ashiqui 2Why: In Telugu there is a saying that “mana kopame mana satruvu”
98, I found this through the entire movie
98, The movie starts with the introduction of hero with a theme song which describes the character of hero and his attitude
98, The introduction scene also explains how the name and fame will degrade individual`s character
98,
98,Meerkats eating habits is mentioned in the lecture
98, The sentinel meerkat stands guard near the burrows
98, The meerkats eat before the standing guard
98, The standing guard may have full stomach
98,Recent studies gave a very better example for understanding altruism among both humans and animals
98, There are some people who donate their kidney to other
98, It doesnot gain increase in sense for him or it doesnot earn fame for himThe people in the society may be of different types
98, If we consider the young people in society most of them feels free to live away from their parents and wants to live as they wish
98, This helps them to develop their individuality
98,The individuals those who live away from their parents may get success in their life but they don’t achieve complete goal of their life
98, As a child of them every youngster has some responsibilities to do for their family and for their parents
98,There are many great personalities who stayed along with their parents even after their success
98, For example Abraham Lincoln the first president of America used to stay along with his father in their paddy fields in order to help him
98,For every individual teenage is more precious and important in their life and it also acts like a turning point in their life
98, If the individual stays away from their parents there will be more chances for him to destroy or to change his mind set
98, Because when he stays away from his parents he thinks that he can do anything which he wants to do
98, This leads him to a chance for addicting to bad habits
98,In other case we will find some adults who stay along with their parents for a long time
98, The reason behind was they want to do something for their parents by helping them and staying along with them in times of need
98,It is not true that all the adults who stay away from their family/parents needed to be addicted to bad habits
98, There will be also more chances to find youngsters who addicted to bad habits even if they stay along with their parents
98,Whether we live away/along with parents it’s only our character which decides our ability individuality
98,I think any of the situations is better and it becomes more fruitful when we are capable of maintaining/controlling our mind within our limits
98,

98,She explained to me how much struggle she made to settle in her and now she is in good position in her society
98," The line which made me to get influenced to her is ""We should not forget past from where we came and we should treat all people in our society as equal"""
98,Whenever I get depressed she motivates me and builds strength in me
